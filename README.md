Run `download.sh`. Some links will go to external domains that you don't want to recursively scrape, so manually download those and put the mappings in `mappings.txt`. Then run `replace.sh`.

You might also want to download lecture questions and answers manually (from 6858.csail.mit.edu, which requires auth) as mhtml files (see the `rq/` folder). The updated `questions.html` reflects those newer file paths.

To get Piazza questions, use https://gist.github.com/yasyf/06801c37f1785cc430b52edc87c648ea.
