Paper Reading Questions
</h1>

<a name="top"></a>
<p>
For each paper, your assignment is two-fold.  Before lecture:

<ul>
<li>Submit your answer for each lecture's paper question via the
    <a href="labs/handin.html">submission web site</a> in a file named
    <code>lec<var>n</var>.txt</code>, and
<li>Submit your own question about the paper (e.g., what you find most confusing about
    the paper or the paper's general context/problem) in a file named
    <code>sq<var>n</var>.txt</code>.
    You cannot
    use the question below.  To the extent possible, during lecture we will try to
    answer these questions.  Below, we have included the questions we've received
    from students in past years (when available), along with answers to those
    questions, in case you find it helpful.
</ul>

<p id="submit-links" style="visibility:hidden; position:fixed">
    Once you submit your own question and answer (or after the deadline
    has passed), you can view the
    <a href="questions.html" id="question-view-link">questions</a>
    and
    <a href="questions.html" id="answer-view-link">answers</a>
    that other students submitted.

    <b>Warning:</b> You must have Javascript enabled to view a specific question.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="q-baggy" class="questionbox">
    <p>
    Suppose <tt>slot_size</tt> is set to 16 bytes.
    Consider the following code snippet:

    <pre>
      char *p = malloc(256);
      char *q = p + 256;
      char ch = *q;
    </pre>

    <p>
    Explain whether or not baggy bounds checking will raise an exception
    at the dereference of <tt>q</tt>.
  </div>

  <div id="q-xfi" class="questionbox">
    <p>
    Suppose a program has a buffer overflow vulnerability which allows
    an attacker to overwrite a function pointer on the stack (which is
    invoked shortly after the buffer is overflowed). Explain whether or not
    an attacker is able to exploit the vulnerability if the same program is run
    under XFI.
  </div>

  <div id="q-okws" class="questionbox">
    <p>
    What's the worst that could happen if one service in OKWS were to leak

    List possible causes of false negatives (missed vulnerabilities)
    and false positives (reported problems that are not vulnerabilities)
    in the system described by the paper.
    </p>

  <div id="q-frame" class="questionbox">
    <p>
    Is the descendant policy just as secure as the child policy
    for frame navigation?  Either explain why it is so, or describe
    a concrete counter-example.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="q-forcehttps" class="questionbox">
    <p>
    Suppose that a web application developer wants to avoid the security
    pitfalls described in the ForceHTTPS paper.  The developer uses HTTPS
    for the application's entire site, and marks all of the application's
    cookies as "Secure".  If the developer makes no mistakes in doing so,
    are there still reasons to use ForceHTTPS?  Explain why not, or provide
    examples of specific attacks that ForceHTTPS would prevent.
  </div>

  <div id="q-kerberos" class="questionbox">
    <p>
    What is the worst that could happen if the private key of a user is
    stolen (i.e., becomes known to an adversary)?  Similarly, what is
    the worst that could happen if the private key of a service is
    stolen?  How should the compromised user or service recover?  Think
    about possible vulnerabilities in the recovery process if the user
    or service key is known to an adversary.

    In BitLocker's design, Windows has a key to decrypt the contents of
    the drive.
    <ol>
      <li>What prevents the adversary from extracting this key from Windows?
      <li>If the adversary cannot extract the key, what prevents him or her
	  from simply using Windows to access files?
    </ol>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="q-resin" class="questionbox">

    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="q-backtracker" class="questionbox">
    <p>
    <!-- If a system administrator does not run Backtracker, how could they find

	 Backtracker required? -->
    How could an adversary circumvent Backtracker, so that an administrator
    cannot pinpoint the initial intrusion point?

    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="q-captchas" class="questionbox">
    <p>
    Given that CAPTCHAs can be solved quite cheaply, do you think that

    mechanism, or not use any mechanism at all (e.g., if you believe
    any mechanism will be cheap to break, like CAPTCHAs)?  Explain your
    reasoning.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="q-xss" class="questionbox">
    <p>
    A browser cross-site scripting filter is a common client-side XSS
    prevention mechanism built into many modern browsers. Here's
    a brief description of what it does, in the words of Adam Barth,
    one of the creators of such filters, XSS Auditor: "Basically,
    the filter checks each script before it executes to see whether
    the script appears in the request that generated the page.  If it
    finds a match, it blocks the script from executing.  [...]". Do
    you think such a filter may be effective at detecting DOM-based
    (entirely client-side) cross-site scripting? Please explain.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="q-static-scripting" class="questionbox">
    <p>
    The paper only mentions one potential false positives arising because
    of the use of regular expression. Explain why it is indeed a false
    positive.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="q-gatekeeper" class="questionbox">
    <p>
    Why is it necessary to treat innerHTML field assignments in a special
    way in the Gatekeeper analysis?
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="q-object-views" class="questionbox">
    <p>
    Security and performance are often at odds in computer systems. Do you feel that object views is a performant 
    enough mechanism for everyday use?
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="q-slammer" class="questionbox">
    <p>
    What are some of the disadvantages of fast-propagating worms?
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="q-virus" class="questionbox">
    <p>
      The paper discusses the possibility of using memory scanning to deal with the problems of obfuscation, encryption, and polymorphism. While memory scanning will enable signature-based detection, do you see any drawbacks of this approach?
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="q-nozzle" class="questionbox">
    <p>
      JavaScript malware often uses a variety of environment detection techniques. One such technique is to check the version of the browser, plugins such as Adobe Acrobat or Flash, operating system, etc. before delivering an exploit deliberately designed for that platform and environment configuration, as illustrated by the pseudocode below. 
<pre>
if(browser-is-ie-6 && adober-flash-version==10.1){
  heap_spray();
}
</pre>
This leads to more reliable, successful exploits for the attacker. Do you see how this pattern may lead to false negatives in a runtime detector?
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="q-android" class="questionbox">
    <p>
      The paper mentions that typical Android applications execute on top of
      a Java virtual machine.  What is the role of Java in ensuring overall
      security?
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="q-taintdroid" class="questionbox">
    <p>
      Would it be reasonable to run TaintDroid to track what data
      applications may be exfiltrating from your phone at all times?
      Would it be reasonable to use TaintDroid to enforce policies like
      ``no application can send my IMEI to the Internet''?  Explain why
      or why not, and what changes would be needed to make TaintDroid
      applicable, if not.
    </p>
  </div>


  <div id="q-repriv" class="questionbox">
    <p>
      While privacy seems to be one clear benefit of client-side personalization, what are some of the disadvantages of it?
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="q-identity" class="questionbox">
    <p>
      What are the disadvantages of using a human-readable, pseudonymous
      identifier for the user within a federated identity system,
      instead of a crypto key or a long string of hexadecimal numbers?
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="q-spam" class="questionbox">
    <p>
      How could the operators of the spam value chain, studied in this
      paper, make it more difficult to repeat such studies in the future?
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="q-usable" class="questionbox">
    <p>
      After reading this paper, propose some ideas for how you might improve
      the usability of securely accessing WebSIS (<tt>http://student.mit.edu</tt>).
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="q-trinc" class="questionbox">
    <p>
      Suppose you are building an online multi-person game.  You are
      worried that a player can cheat in various ways by modifying
      the game software, since it runs on the player's own computer,
      or sending arbitrary network messages to your game server.
      What security properties could you get by using TrInc in your
      game (e.g., a trinket comes in the box when you buy a game)?
      What security problems cannot be solved with TrInc?
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="q-capsicum" class="questionbox">
    <p>
      The authors of the Capsicum paper describe several strategies
      for how to use Capsicum in several applications (Section 4).
      How would you recommend using Capsicum in the different components
      of OKWS?  Are there features missing from Capsicum that would have
      made it easier to build OKWS?
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="q-websec" class="questionbox">
    <p>
      Suppose you are helping the developers of a complex web site at
      http://bitdiddle.com/ to evaluate their security.  This web site
      uses an HTTP cookie to authenticate users.  The site developers
      are worried an adversary might steal the cookie from one of the
      visitors to the site, and use that cookie to impersonate the
      victim visitor.
    </p>

    <p>
      What should the developers look at in order to determine if
      a user's cookie can be stolen by an adversary?  In other words,
      what kinds of adversaries might be able to steal the cookie of one
      of the visitors to http://bitdiddle.com/, what goes "wrong"
      to allow the adversary to obtain the cookie, and how might the
      developers prevent it?
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Note:</i> an exhaustive answer might be quite long, so you
      can stop after about 5 substantially-different issues that the

      Suppose an adversary discovers a bug in NaCl where the checker
      incorrectly determines the length of a particular x86 instruction.
      How could an adversary exploit this to escape the inner sandbox?

  </div>

  <div id="q-u2f" class="questionbox">
    <p>
      Two-factor Authentication (2FA) is commonly used to authenticate
      users. For example, MIT allows as a second factor a code sent via an SMS
      message to the user's cell phone.  The FIDO standard describes a 2FA
      scheme using a USB dongle.  Which scheme is more secure? Which scheme is
      more user friendly?
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="q-passwords" class="questionbox">
    <p>
      Based on the different schemes described in the paper, what do
      you think would be a reasonable choice for authenticating users in
      the following scenarios, and what trade-offs would you have to make:

      <ol>
        <li>Logging in to a public Athena machine in a cluster.
        <li>Checking your balance on a bank's web site via HTTPS from a private laptop.

    <p>
      Which of the vulnerabilities described in this paper (A1 through A5)
      do you think could have been found with some kind of automated tool
      (such as fuzzing or program analysis) and what might such a tool
      look like?

  <div id="q-sybilrank" class="questionbox">
    <p>
      Could large email providers, such as GMail, Yahoo Mail, or
      Hotmail, use ideas from SybilLimit to better detect spam email?
      What assumptions would they need to check?

  <div id="q-tcpip" class="questionbox">
    <p>
      Steve Bellovin's ``A Look Back'' paper was published in 2004,
      over 10 years ago (and the paper itself is a retrospective on
      his earlier paper from 1989).  Which of the security problems in
      the TCP/IP protocol suite described in Steve Bellovin's paper are
      still relevant today?
    </p>

  <div id="q-django" class="questionbox">
    <p>
      After you have read about Django's security mechanisms, think
      back to ``The Tangled Web''.  What security pitfalls still remain
      for developers using Django?  Could you extend Django to help
      developers avoid those pitfalls, in a style similar to Django's
      existing protections?

  <div id="q-private-browsing" class="questionbox">
    <p>
      For the different parts of the browser state shown in Tables 1-3,
      what are the security implications of a "yes"?  Consider both of
      the two threat models that the authors put forward for private
      browsing.

  </div>

  <div id="q-dropbox" class="questionbox">
    <p>
      What do Dropbox developers gain from the obfuscation measures
      described in the paper?  Could they have made it impossible for
      the authors to perform this kind of reverse-engineering?

  <div id="q-cryptdb" class="questionbox">
    <p>
      Consider the following query:
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre>  SELECT SUM(GREATEST(salary, 100)) FROM employees;</pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The <tt>GREATEST(a, b)</tt> function returns the larger
      of <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt>, so the above query returns
      the sum of all salaries in the <tt>employees</tt> table,
      rounding up any salaries below 100 to 100.
    </p>

    <p>
      How could CryptDB rewrite this query to execute over
      encrypted data, using the encryption schemes described
      in the paper?

  <div id="q-brop" class="questionbox">
    <p>
      For a BROP attack to succeed, the server must not rerandomize canaries
      after crashing. Suppose that, after a server crashes, it creates
      a new canary by SHA1-hashing the current gettimeofday() value. Is
      this new scheme secure?
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="q-klee" class="questionbox">
    <p>
      KLEE uses a satisfiability (SAT/SMT) solver to implement symbolic
      execution.  What would go wrong if KLEE did not use a SAT/SMT solver,
      and instead tried all branches?  What would go wrong if KLEE just
      guessed randomly about what a symbolic value could be?

  </div>

  <div id="q-urweb" class="questionbox">
    <p>
      What kinds of security vulnerabilities are still possible in an
      Ur/Web application?  One approach might be to keep the OWASP
      Top-10 list in mind as you are reading the Ur/Web paper, and
      consider whether Ur/Web's features can eliminate certain classes
      of bugs, or whether it's still possible to have vulnerabilities.
    </p>

    <p>
      A note from the paper author: this paper is a draft of a camera-ready
      conference paper, and if you have any bug reports or suggestions about
      the paper, the author (Adam Chlipala, adamc@csail.mit.edu) would
      appreciate your feedback!

  <div id="q-medsw" class="questionbox">
    <p>
      Security engineering classes often focus on technological mechanisms
      such as cryptography or programming techniques (i.e., controls) to
      prevent security problems, but safety and biomedical engineering
      classes tend to focus on risk management to balance risks and
      benefits.  Consider the situation of requiring fast emergency access
      to control an implanted medical device that must also remain secure.
      If the overarching goal is patient safety, how might your choice
      of security mechanisms differ from traditional computing contexts?
      How do we achieve both safety and security while balancing risks
      and benefits that ensure patient safety?

  <div id="q-exe" class="questionbox">
    <p>
      Each time EXE adds a branch constraint it
      queries STP to check that there exists at least one solution for the
      current path's constraints.  What would go wrong if EXE did not use STP,
      and instead tried all branches?  What would go wrong if EXE randomly

      Suppose an adversary compromises the insecure operating system
      running on a user's desktop computer, and when the user tries
      to launch their secure document editor using Cloud Terminal,
      the adversary opens their look-alike document editor instead.
      How can a user determine that they are interacting with a ``fake''
      application and not the real secure document editor?  What prevents
      the adversary from fooling the user?
