<h1> 6.858: Questions for lecture 10 </h1>

<ul>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is it possible to implement software sandbo=
xing on mobile devices similar to the techniques implemented in personal co=
mputers?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">So, what I got from the paper was that the =
Apple code reviewers only look for "obvious bugs or other problems" when re=
viewing an app for publishing, but the only thing deterring people from cre=
ating malicious apps is the fact that they're "identifiable." (under App Se=
curity, App code signing, 2nd paragraph)

I was just looking at the Apple Developer Program, and it looks like you on=
ly need an Apple ID and a credit card to create an account, and to create a=
n Apple ID, you only really need basic personal info (name, address, phone =
number) and an email address.

Couldn't someone create a junk email address, then create an Apple ID with =
fake information, then create an Apple Developer Program account with that =
Apple ID and, say, illegally-obtained credit card info, and then publish a =
malicious app? Is there some other form of protection in this process that =
I'm missing?=20

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">"The note's contents are encrypted using AE=
S-GCM. New records are created in Core Data and CloudKit to store the&nbsp;=
encrypted note, tag, and initialization vector, and the original note recor=
ds are&nbsp;deleted; the encrypted data isn't written in place."

Didn't quite get the significance of not writing in-place. Are there known =
issues in doing so?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">"Touch&nbsp;ID security
The resulting map of nodes is stored without any identity
information in an encrypted format that can only be read by the Secure Encl=
ave,
and is never sent to Apple or backed up to iCloud or iTunes."

What does it mean by "without any identity information"? If it means withou=
t labeling whose fingerprint the map is associated to, I am not sure how th=
is step is useful because I think each iOS device can have only one user. P=
lus, the mapping is already
lossy so the attacker wouldn't be able to use it to construct the user's ac=
tual
fingerprint anyway?

"iOS supports six-digit, four-digit, and arbitrary-length alphanumeric
passcodes. In addition to unlocking the device, a passcode provides entropy=
 for certain encryption keys. [...] The stronger the user passcode is, the =
stronger the encryption key becomes. Touch&nbsp;ID and Face&nbsp;ID can be =
used to enhance this equation by enabling
the&nbsp;user to establish a much stronger passcode than would otherwise be
practical."

What if the user only uses passcodes and sets very weak passcodes? Would hi=
s data
be less secure? Is this a good design decision?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">- What is the purpose of DFU mode? Why not =
skip it and go directly to recovery mode?

- Why doesn=E2=80=99t iTunes also download only the components required to =
complete an update (like OTA does)? Is it because it is fast enough already=
?

- How is Touch/Face ID considered a second factor (page 11)? Isn=E2=80=99t =
it the only factor?

- On page 14, are the keys in the diagram only accessible by Secure Enclave=
? Or, are only the ones with blue locks exclusive to Secure Enclave?

- Touch ID and Face ID information is stored in Secure Enclave - is passcod=
e information stored there too?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">1. Can you please go over the figure on pag=
e 4 and connect it with the sections we read?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">1. Not being able to revert back to old ver=
sions is problematic right? I remember when spectre and meltdown were annou=
nced, patches for linux didn't go well with nvidia drivers and rendered scr=
eens unusable, we had to revert back to the previous version. Couldn't some=
thing like this happen for iphones?

2. With frequent camera usage for faceid, this becomes a power problem, whi=
ch doesn't seem to be worth the tradeoff of having this slight convience. C=
ommericially is this convience that important? Also I was wondering what yo=
ur opinions on the value of facid is? I personally don't see any use for it=
 and poses a step back in security if anything.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">1. The article makes some claims that FaceI=
d is a good biometric measure, and even has fewer collisions in a populatio=
n than TouchId, but it seems fairly easy to unlock someone's device by poin=
ting it towards an "attentive" photo of them. So, would you recommend facia=
l recognition as a security mechanism in this use case?

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">A lot of the security measures described re=
ly on cryptographic keys. We haven't been taught about keys explicitly in t=
his class, so we currently have to take Apple's word that they are using it=
 correctly and that they are highly secure. Will we be covering how cryptog=
raphic keys work, or is there some good, concise resources to learn more ab=
out them?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Apple appears to have thought through their=
 security solution very thoroughly; how does iOS security compare to Androi=
d security?
Does Google have a harder time maintaining a secure product than Apple?</pr=
e></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Apple boasts about the secure boot chain an=
d how it helps "ensure that the lowest levels of software aren=E2=80=99t ta=
mpered with", but it seems that jailbreaking an iPhone is well known and co=
mmon.  How does jailbreaking get around these protections and ultimately al=
low other 3rd party apps and functions to work on the device?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Apple claims that Face ID is very secure (1=
/1,000,000 chance of false positive) except for children or look-alike sibl=
ings, but I=E2=80=99ve seen some hack videos that seem to be able to fake a=
 face. What do people in the security world think of Face ID? </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Apple claims that FaceID is more secure - h=
owever I've seen articles about Apple thinking that Chinese women who look =
nothing alike are the same person. Is this a general problem for population=
s that Apple might not have had enough training data for?=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Apple limit's the use of Write+Execute page=
s to Apple only application.
This is to prevent applications from JIT'ing code, but this also is
quite a resiriction on the ecosystem. Is there are fundamental security
reason for why Apple didn't opt for sandboxing or in the style of Native Cl=
ient
or eBPF in the kernel?

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Apple mentions anti-replay services. I am g=
enerally familiar with replay attacks which are simply replaying a valid ac=
tion but for malicious intent. I am aware generally incrementing ids are us=
ed to prevent replays (because the messages are encrypted the adversary can=
t find a larger id). Does apple do the same? And how does the encryption wo=
rk because the device is same for the interaction...
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Apple says that it's sandboxing "prevents a=
pps from gathering or modifying information stored by other apps". How do s=
ecurity people view app-monitoring apps like Onavo, that gather and sell da=
ta about other apps' usage (like resources)? Is there any effort to make ap=
ps "totally unaware" of other processes running on the machine outside thei=
r sandbox?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Apple serves as the root trust-authority fo=
r many applications. What would happen if an attacker could sign arbitrary =
software as Apple?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Apple signs the bootloading code and iOS re=
sets itself if the code's signature doesn't match. So, how does JailBreak w=
ork then?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Apple took care in defending against face d=
etection spoofing by training neural networks to detect digital and physica=
l spoofs. However, nothing is mentioned about fingerprint spoofing, which m=
akes me still question the security of TouchID being used in place of a pas=
scode. Instead of using TouchID as a way to expedite the unlocking process,=
 why not use it as a second factor?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Are there any parts of the core of Apple's =
devices (in terms of software) that are not made by Apple? It seems like th=
ey control the entire ecosystem, which seems like a good plan for security,=
 so I was wondering if there was any point at which they use software that =
they did not develop in-house? (Besides at the application level)
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">As is the case with the google paper, I'm s=
till unsure about why Apple goes in so much detail about their security inf=
rastructure. What is the advantage in doing so?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Attack: Somebody steals Ben's phone, takes =
it apart, and tries to remove the memeory chip and put it on another device=
 to read it.
Mitigation: The UID crytographically ties data to a particular device.

Attack: Somebody steals Ben's phone, takes it apart, and tries to hook it u=
p to a different fingerprint scanner in order to unlock the phone.
Mitigation: There is a shared key between the secure enclave and the touch =
ID sensor such that only the original touch ID sensor can be used.

Attack: If Ben's secure notes app is touch ID protected, then an attacker w=
ho knows the passcode could add their fingerprint and use it to access the =
confidential notes.
Mitigation: Apple allows apps to not allow touchID if the fingerprint list =
has changed since the last login.

Attack: An attacker creates a malicious app that, if downloaded, would some=
how be able to access the confidential notes.
Mitigation: There are a lot of them. App developrs are required to register=
 with Apple. Apps are run in their own sandboxes and can only access their =
own files.

Attack: An attacker creates a malicious version of the confidential notes a=
pp used.
Mitigation: Apps must be signed.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Because each secure enclave UID is generate=
d independently
on each device, does that mean that Apple cannot access=20
information on a device requiring secure enclave UID for
access?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Can the adversary unlock an iPhone X using =
the user's photo or by positioning it in front of the user while the user i=
s asleep?</pre></li>

Lecture 10

If Apple approves of an App Creator through their system, but they create a=
 malicious app anyways and release it, is there
further action taken (eg. legal) than simply shutting down the app and revo=
king their privileges to add apps to the store?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Do jailbreaking bugs demonstrate the subver=
sions of most of these security measures? Do they atleast break the verifie=
d bootloader section of the white paper, or are they more limited
in scope?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Does Apple have any recent protections agai=
nst jailbreaking a device?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Does Apple provided iOS devices with the op=
tion to wipe data remotely (as long as internet connection is still maintai=
ned)? It seems like a good security step to include as well, for example in=
 cases where Ben accidentally leaves his iPhone somewhere in a public area.=
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Does iOS compete or collaborate with Androi=
d in developing its security architecture?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Does the hardware level encryption prevent =
users from upgrading between phones or copying a backup to a new phone with=
 out loosing phone/app data? It seems like all the security data may have t=
o be re-setup, but what of other data stored in the enclave?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">From my understanding the UID is generated =
within the hardware instead of a manufacturing process(so that basically no=
 entity should know the exact UID without somehow reverse engineering the h=
ardware). So how does this work in general? Specifically, I can imagine tha=
t some source of randomness must be taken into account.=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Given such strong security, how does Apple =
allow for a user to recover forgotten passwords in cases where they did not=
 set a FaceID or TouchID?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Has Apple published anything more in-depth =
about its Secure Enclave? I'm curious to see how it compares to Intel's enc=
lave that we discussed in class.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Have there been any recent exploits with iO=
S security? Other than the weakness with the face recognition, I've been le=
d to believe that iOS is pretty secure.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How are alternate versions of ios loaded du=
ring DFU mode (for jailbreaks, for example)?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How are any device security mechanisms effe=
ctive if an sufficiently-motivated attacker has physical access to the devi=
ce? (e.g. for awhile, the FBI was unable to unlock a San Bernardino shooter=
's iPhone.) Couldn't the FBI have (e.g.) disassembled the iPhone and physic=
ally examined the storage in order to access the data/any necessary encrypt=
ion keys?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How did iOS jailbreaking work?  Do these se=
curity measures protect from this?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How does Android device security compare to=
 iOS?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How does Apple check application code in a =
scalable manner?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How does Apple check whether third party ap=
ps are actually secure? It seems unlikely that if there's an application ru=
nning third party ads as a revenue model, that Apple can check its veracity=
. Even YouTube had a problem with some ads using the users for cryptomining=
.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How does Apple ensure its iTunes update ser=
ver won't be=20
compromised? If the server is compromised, will the iOS
device be attacked? Or installed a malicious system? </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How does apple handle security on the algor=
ithms used for face and touchID. Both of these seem like they should be pro=
ne to adversarial examples, more so than passcodes where there is a single =
exact answer. Does apple do testing beyond the normal testing to ensure tha=
t a 3d mask of a person, or someone who looks similar cannot unlock the pho=
ne, because this would seem to make all the encryption moot since someone c=
ould just  pass a fake face to the faceID and still get access?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How does face ID protect against using a ma=
sk?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How does iOS jailbreaking work -- which par=
ts of the security architecture does it target?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How does the antireplay feature of the secu=
re enclave work?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How does the concept of iOS "Jailbreaking" =
fit within these schemes? I would
imagine it must involve breaking some of the code-signing security mechanis=
ms,
albeit with the consent of the end user.=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How much does all of the added layers of en=
cryption affect performance of
accessing files, especially if these files are protected under layers of
encryption usering a hierarchy of keys?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How much of the app checking process is aut=
omated and how easy is it to automate this? If not, it seems like a number =
of bugs can be introduced via manual inspection or something semi-automated=
.

Is address space randomization sufficient? I thought there were known attac=
ks on it.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How secure has Face ID been in practice? I'=
ve heard numerous stories of unlocks that make me skeptical of the 1 in 1,0=
00,000 unlock chance claim. Are there practical ways to spoof Face ID using=
, for example, 3D printing?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How thorough is Apple's vetting process for=
 App Store apps?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I assume getting the processor to read some=
 arbitrary key rather than Apple's public key from ROM would give an attack=
er control over the boot chain - is this prevented by anything other than p=
rohibitive physical difficulty?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I didn't quite follow the discussion of Fac=
e ID diagnostics. How does this
process work? When users opt to send diagnostics in, it says they can look
through each image and select which ones to send to Apple. Would this possi=
bly
allow an attacker to obtain a device and run a controlled diagnostics proce=
ss
that led to them gaining future access to the device?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I feel like this paper was a bit vague abou=
t how it was handling jailbroken
devices, only claiming that the data is still hardware encrypted. Why does
Apple feel the need to mention jailbroken devices at all? How often do
Apple or other large companies consider improper device usage in their
security plan?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I saw recently that some foreign contractin=
g company has claimed they can unlock any iOS device. In your opinion, what=
 would be the most vulnerable component of Apple's security scheme? That is=
, if you were the lead for a penetration testing team, what security compon=
ent would you target first, and why?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I'm confused about all the different types =
of keys used in the data protection section (class keys, data protection ke=
ys, file keys?). Which of these encryption schemes are asymmetric (public/p=
rivate) and which are symmetric?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">If keyboard apps don't allow access to the =
network at all, how do predictive keyboards gather data to train and improv=
e their models?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">If the data is automatically wiped after 10=
 incorrect tries, can't a malicious user destroy your data by entering 10 i=
ncorrect passwords into your device?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">If the iPhone BootROM ensures that only App=
le signed software can run, how do people jailbreak their iPhones?

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">In order to enable security, IOS sacrifices=
 a lot of flexibility and user control. What tradeoffs are okay to make for=
 the sake of security?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">In the iOS security paper it says:

The probability that a random person in the population
could look at your iPhone X and unlock it using Face
ID is approximately 1 in 1,000,000 (versus
1 in 50,000 for Touch ID).

First off, is touch ID secure if 1/50,000 people can effortlessly unlock yo=
ur
phone? The "unsecure" android patterns still have 389,112 possible patterns
you can draw.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is one of the larger benefits that Apple co=
ntrols their product (all their hardware and software) that they can enforc=
e much stronger security factors? (they can make certain assumptions about =
the security of various components?)
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is the secure enclave designed exclusively =
for cryptographic and security
functions? While I don't expect it to have a huge amount of computation
power, having a seperate processor that's presumably usually inactive
seems a little wasteful.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is there a way to modify a backup and then =
load it into the phone?
How easy is it to access effaceable storage?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is there some way for apple to use 2FA to m=
ake their devices even more secure?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">It seems that Apple chooses strict App isol=
ation to protect security. Does this restrict interprocess communication am=
ong apps that may want to achieve some level of sharing?=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">It seems that touch/face ID aren't secure i=
f the phone is never turned off. Someone could use a dead/sleeping person t=
o unlock the phone. I can't think of a solution that gets rid of this probl=
em without removing the accessibilities of these kinds of user authenticati=
on. Do you know if there are any ways around this?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I=E2=80=99ve heard a lot of controversy abo=
ut fooling the new face ID. Also it seems like for a phone, adversaries pri=
marily care about wiping the phone, resetting it and then re-selling it. Ho=
w does the security measures prevent against that?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Lecture 10 (Question About Paper)

It seems like the secure boot chain relies on an attacker not being able to=
 know the Apple Root CA private key. Otherwise, an attacker might be able t=
o get users to download malicious software updates that pass all the secure=

Apple tries to make its device secure by often relying on a chain of trust,=
 eg often with the secure enclave or the Apple authorization server. The se=
cure enclave does seem isolated/secure, though its still a little unclear t=
o me how Apple ensures it's properly updated, aside from a "personalized so=
ftware update process." Though the mention how the Apple authorization serv=
er has many checks regarding the time, identity, and content of update pack=
ages and also signed and authorized update packages, are there still vulner=
ablitiles regarding the passage of said data over this unsecure network?</p=

How exactly does Apple's address space layout randomization work? I am a bi=

the addresses of stored data can be shuffled at random and managed in a way=
 that would allow the
system to execute properly, and then be efficient on top of that.

Thank you!

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Older phones were notorious for allowing co=
mpromize via the baseband procesor,
but it seems that iPhones at least now isolate this proccess from accessing=
 the

also common on other devices (like Android)?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">On page 7, third paragraph, there is mentio=

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">On pg.24, Apple talks about how Safari's Ja=

 3rd party apps. How much damage can this compiler do related to things we'=
ve seen before like buffer overflows/making system calls, etc?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">One attack scenario is for the adversary to=
 tamper with the boot code - Apple defends against this through verifying t=
he entire chain of trust to ensure all hardware/software has been signed by=
 Apple. Another scenario is for the attacker to guess the password - Apple =
helps lower the possibility of this by implementing limited tries, and allo=
wing the option for the user to enable TouchID/FaceID. To further ensure th=
e safety of the user=E2=80=99s notes data, Apple has encryption and data pr=
otection features built in.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">One of the most intriguing part of the docu=
ment is FaceID and TouchID. In particular,
I was impressed to know that the probability of 1 in one million was calcul=
ated for FaceID -
the first question, of course, is how they calculated this?. They also ment=
ion an API that
simply returns a boolean that confirms that FaceID or TouchID was correctly=
 identified. Wouldn't
simply tapping in in the connection and setting up an arbitrary boolean suf=
fice to corrupt the system then?

What is the process for screening apps from valid developers before allowin=
g them to be on the Apple Store?

Is there any checks in place to help users from granting excessive permissi=
ons to an app?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Regarding NSFileProtectionNone, the paper s=
ays "Since all the keys needed to
decrypt files in this class are stored on the device, the encryption only
affords the benefit of fast remote wipe." How does this protection class af=
ford
the benefit of fast remote wipe?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Since a secure boot chain is employed to bo=
ot apple devices, would unofficial software modifications render a device u=
seless?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">So the paper talks about Apple encoding the=
 device's unique ID and device
group ID - it feels like maybe the manufacturer can mess with this if they
tried. How hard or possible is it to actually just try and get the keys fro=
m
the encoded chip?=20

I don't know too much about the process about how the keys are encoded into
the chip. </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">So, Apple mentioned the following, "Convers=
ely, if Face=EF=BF=BDID fails to
recognize you, but the match quality is higher than a certain threshold and=
 you
immediately follow the failure by entering your passcode, Face=EF=BF=BDID t=
akes another
capture and augments its enrolled Face=EF=BF=BDID data with the newly calcu=
lated
mathematical representation."  Depending on the threshold, does this mean t=
hat a sibling with a similar face and/or a friend could then slow augment t=
he phone's data to include their face, eventually allowing for a user to un=
lock it?  I'm imaging the threshold must be high to avoid this case, though=
, but at the same time, Apple mentions that they can register your face in =
many common cases that might be an issue.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The Data Protection classes seem to serve a=
 similar function to capabilities but are implemented differently. Is there=
 a reason the file protections weren't implemented with capabilities?=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The article states that "The probability th=
at a random person in the population could look at your iPhone X and unlock=
 it using Face&nbsp;ID is approximately 1 in 1,000,000 (versus 1 in 50,000 =
for Touch&nbsp;ID)."  We've been hearing for a while that having a random a=
lphanumeric password (including specials) below 8 characters long is no lon=
ger acceptable due to the fact that computers are fast enough to quickly en=
umerate the space.  Conversely, picking a random 6-digit *number* would yie=
ld a similar 1 in 1,000,000 chance of a random guess catching it.  When com=
paring Face/TouchID to the equivalent random password, it seems to clearly =
be insufficient for properly securing a system.

Finally, my question is this: how did Apple come to the 1/50k and 1/1mil nu=
mbers for their login capabilities and how realistic are these numbers?  </=

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The article touched on how neural networks =
are used for FaceID after combining the image with high precision depth inf=

?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The document doesn cover any threats and pr=
otection measures regarding the cloud part of Apple ecosystem. Despite devi=
ce-level encryption, I'm sure there're some potential attack vectors which =
can be associated with the cloud. https://www.elcomsoft.com/PR/epb_180208_e=
n.pdf Apple website covers this topic very briefly. https://support.apple.c=
om/en-us/HT202303. Are there any other insights available?

There is a lot of regular hype in press announcing that iOS is not that sec=
ure and it creates a dichotomy between the comprehensive security measures =
of probably one of the most secure OS in the world and the noise about its =
weaknesses. https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2018/02/26/governme=

Can you elaborate please on these topics?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The file data protection details was a litt=
le confusing, and I=E2=80=99m not clear of the details when keys are wrappe=
d and unwrapped, especially when talking about ephemeral keys.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The key hierarchy seems useful for access c=
ontrol and dividing files based on their security needs. However, why are p=
er file keys necessary? Why could the hardware use the same metadata key to=
 encrypt the files themselves as needed? In the current system if one can g=
ain the metadata key then they can already access all keys, so this does no=
t seem to decrease security. In summary the current system seems to have a =
shared key as the weakest link, so why not just use this shared key?</pre><=
/li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The paper discusses data protection using a=
 concept they called "per file keys", in which they separated different dat=
a into classes that have differing levels of security.  It seems to me that=
 this is a form of privilege separation, but what type of threat model is t=
his helping to protect/secure against?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The paper mentions "Data Protection allows =
the device to respond to common events such as incoming phone calls, but al=
so enables a high level of encryption for user data." Does needing to servi=
ce phone calls mean that some extra work had to be done in designing Data P=
rotection? Are there phone-call-based attacks?

In a compact, haiku form:
Phone-call-based attacks?
How do "common events" make
encryption tricky?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The paper mentions that if a file is cloned=
 in the Apple File System, each half of the clone gets a new key to write i=
ncoming writes, while the old data is still protected by the old key. What =
is the rationale behind this in terms of performance and security? It seems=
 simpler to implement a copy by re-encrypting the file with a new key.=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The paper mentions that when updating via i=
Tunes, the entire iOS is downloaded, while when updating over the air, only=
 a differential part is updated.

What is the point of downloading the entire iOS application, if it's possib=
le to upgrade just by installing a differential part? Is it more secure to =
download the entire OS?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The paper talks about how the UID and GID a=
re securely protected. What kind of attack
would an adversary be able to launch if they were able to read the UID and/=
or GID?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The support that iOS has for crypto operati=
ons is really great, but one thing that seemed to be glossed over was the e=
xtended trust that Apple gives their own apps. They specify clearly that al=
l 'third-party' apps are sandboxed, but this sort of implies that Apple app=
s are not sandboxed to the same degree. While there are certainly many good=
 reasons for doing this, it seems like it would still greatly increase the =
attack surface of the device, since if an app that is signed by Apple (and =
perhaps not restricted to the same sandbox as third-party software), could =
have a bug or could be compromised by the attacker, who would then be able =
to modify the system as a more privileged app.=20

Since the attacker still cannot change the executable due to code signing, =
this would be more along the lines of a return to libc attack, but instead =
of libc it's a privileged Apple app. The only thing that Apple seems to do =
to protect against this is to use ASLR, but since there are many Apple-deve=
loped apps that are likely to be in user-space, this may not be enough.

Is this 'return to Apple code' attack an issue? Or does Apple assume that t=
heir sandboxing technique is robust enough to protect against this?</pre></=
