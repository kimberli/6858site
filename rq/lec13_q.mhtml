<h1> 6.858: Questions for lecture 13 </h1>

<ul>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">What are some other authentication methods =
that were used before cookies?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">"Even if the owners of the webmail applicat=
ion scope their cookies tightly (usually at the expense of complicating the=
 sign-on process), any attacker who finds a script injection vulnerability =
on the blogging site can simply overflow the per-domain cookie jar, drop th=
e current credentials, and set his own *.example.com cookies. These injecte=
d cookies will be sent to webmail.example.com on all subsequent requests an=
d will be largely indistinguishable from the real ones."

Could you explain what "per-domain cookie jar" is? Does "overflow" here ref=
er to
buffer overflow?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">1. On pg 145, I don't understand how the cr=
oss-site scripting can be used if the attacker points to a page like addres=
s_book that requires logging in when loaded.=20

2. Is the use of about:blank considered more secure because attackers can't=
 navigate directly to the page if it contains sensitive information?=20

3. Have the tools from chapter 9 been replaced now that sandboxing is avail=
able?=20

4. The document mostly focuses on protecting against Javascript attacks and=
 plug-ins. Do Perl or PHP not have the same abilities over the DOM, or are =
they excluded because of JS dominance?

5. How can a website operator correct their website after being made aware =
of a clickjacking situation on their domain? I feel this is a very common a=
ttack used on cellphones still, and many people especially the elderly are =
even less aware of how to escape even though they are often just advertisem=
ent attacks. </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">6.858 - The Tangled Web

Are there ways for different domains to permit cookie sharing with other do=
mains
without allowing other domains with the same document.domain?

It seems like a poor way of permission isolation if cookie sharing is all o=
r nothing.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">After reading these chapters, I=E2=80=99m v=
ery worried about how the web works and if it=E2=80=99s even possible to se=
cure anything I do on the web. Is encryption the only thing preventing ever=
y most attacks?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Any situation we don't want secure flags?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Are there any attempts to make cookie more =
protected (non-overwritable by too many mechanism)? For example, can we set=
 a policy to allow only the intended website to modify cookie?=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Are there any client side security measures=
 one can take to detect/delete cookies that are potentially vulnerable?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Can overwriting a cookie lead to later leak=
ing of credentials? Namely, does overflowing and creating a cookie without =
the httponly and secure flags set
cause the user to write their credentials to the unsecured cookie, or will =
those flags be overwritten on the next legitimate login.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Can you give example exploits using 3rd-par=
ty stylesheets or images? Could a
3rd-party stylesheet do something with opacity, mouse-following, etc.  to
"clickjack" and steal a user's cookie?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Could speak more about how browsers set up =
a secure environment in which to run code and display websites in the first=
 case? How do browsers sandbox themselves? What setup do they do to run Jav=
ascript? How do they verify that their environment hasn't been corrupted by=
 someone messing with their source files on the host OS?


</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Danny Tang

Lecture 13

It seems that an entire overhaul of how the web works would be the best sol=
ution to the issues described in the reading. Would it be
possible to slowly phase out the current system of using frames to share da=
ta/communicate for a more secure system, or are we at a=20
point where it really isn't feasible since the web has grown so large? </pr=
e></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Do ISPs still hijack domain lookups for non=
existent hosts? </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Do cookies ever expire? Or do you build up =
more and more cookies stored on your brower over time?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Does it help to relate Cookie to a random c=
hallenge which differs for each computer? In this way, even if the adversar=
y steals your cookie, he can not use it directly.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Even those this reading is 10 years old, (I=
 know the technical descriptions of
different internet components are still valid) are the vulnerabilities and =
bugs
discussed in the readings still an issue in modern browsers?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">From the readings, it seems like adversarie=
s are almost intraceable. However, as a user, I was wondering how i might b=
e able to tell than an adversary is present, beyond simply checking the url=
.=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Given that there are so many deadly securit=
y vulnerabilities in the web browsers, why are vendors (especially Microsof=
t) so unwilling to provide fixes? Especially for the content sniffing, whic=
h seems particularly dangerous.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Given this book is from 2012, has the brows=
er security landscape changed dramatically since this time? For example, ho=
w do modern browsers extend these ideas to Browser applications using somet=
hing like WebAssembly? I would guess there is some sandboxing involved, but=
 often these applications also need access to some browsing data. When givi=
ng these applications permissions are we simply allowing the application to=
 bypass the security rules discussed?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Has the keystroke-redirection attack been s=
olved since this was published? I can think of some rough heuristics for di=
sallowing it but it seems very tricky to fix.


Bonus question: "Once you submit your own question and answer (or after the=
 deadline has passed), you can view the questions and answers that other st=
udents submitted." - somehow just noticed that and I've definitely been see=
ing a lot of the past questions, so I think I've been turning these in late=
 all semester. Sorry if I'm missing this on the website somewhere, but when=
 is the deadline?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Have there been any improvements/fixes to t=
he security vulnerabilities decribed in the book since the book was release=
d?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How are cookies constructed?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How common are successful session hijacking=
 attacks nowadays?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How do browsers enforce that cross-domains =
can=E2=80=99t set cookies? </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How do the security policy of different bro=
wsers agree with each other - what if different browsers have disagreements=
 on security policies, would developers have to design their website in acc=
ordance to each browser's policy?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How have the current systems adapted to the=
 addition of many new top level domains like .io, .club, etc.?  Is it still=
 the practice to use a chain of if statements to determine these top level =
domains?=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How prevalent are broswer/web based attacks=
 still? What are the primary reasons for them? How much are origin related =
issues still a concern?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I believe many more top-level domains have =
been approved by ICANN since this
book was written.  The author mentions that this would increase the complex=
ity
of cookie domain restrictions, has anything much changed to handle these?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I did not understand most of this reading p=
robably because of a lack of understanding of web security, and because it =
was way too long. Is there some other resource that is shorter and assumes =
less knowledge of web security, that explains some of these concepts?</pre>=
</li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I don't completely understand the example i=
n Figure 11.2. The book says that the policy is that navigation of non-same=
-origin frame is permitted if the requesting party shares the origin with o=
ne of the ancestors in the targeted view. How does this allow bunnyoutlet.c=
om to access a frame nested in fuzzbunnies.com? Where is the overlap in ori=
gin?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I don't quite understand this paragraph on =
p 169:

More interestingly (and far less obviously) than the creation of new
subresources, navigating existing windows or frames to javascript: URLs wil=
l
cause the inlined JavaScript code to execute in the context of the navigate=
d
page (and not the navigating document!)=E2=80=94even if the URL is entered =
man-
ually or loaded from a bookmark.

In particular, what does "navigated page" and "navigating document" mean?

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I dont understand the purpose of the about:=
blank in the example provided in the text (inside Chapter: 10, Section: "Or=
igin Inheritance for about:blank"). We could use javascript scripting to ed=
it the internal HTML source even if the iframe was not set to about:blank, =
or was not set at all -- or is this not correct?=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I still don=E2=80=99t quite understand whet=
her SOP is used for user authentication securities.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I understand that developers use pseudo-url=
s to store html-content locally for faster retrieval, but I don't understan=
d why developers started using them in the first place given that they're n=
ot compatible with SOP. It seems like they have other alternatives for stor=
ing content locally. Were pseudo-urls a feature?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I was really surprised at the long lead-tim=
es b/w vulnerability acknowledgement and patching in web browsers. Are ther=
e such notable cases recently where major browsers have failed to address a=
 major vulnerability in a timely fashion?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I'm a little confused on the use of postMes=
sage. Let's say login.example.com wants to send a message to payments.examp=
le.com - does login.example.com have an iframe with payments.example.com lo=
aded, or does the user have a tab with both payments.example.com and login.=
example.com loaded? Neither of these situations seem to make sense to me.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I'm confused by the httponly flag for cooki=
es. How can a cookie be accessed at all if not through Javascript?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I've heard a lot over the years about how b=
ad Flash is for security, though it seems from the readings that it receive=
d a substantial security overhaul in 2008. However, modern browsers still d=
ecided to kill it off. What was the worst aspect of Flash security? Were co=
nfiguration issues (such as crossdomain.xml) at the heart of why Flash was =
so unsecure?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I've heard that it's a bad idea to click li=
nks in sketchy emails. Why would clicking a link be dangerous? It seems lik=
e the web security model assumes that users can safely visit untrusted webs=
ites. (I understand why one would take precautions *after* clicking a sketc=
hy link, e.g. to ensure that they are not on a phishing site, but I don't u=
nderstand why users are discouraged from clicking sketchy links in the firs=
t place.) Is this just an extra precaution in case the user wouldn't notice=
 a phishing site?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">If a developper needs to build a website wi=
th a frontend running on http://localhost:3000 and a backend running on htt=
p://localhost:8080, since the ports differ, does that mean he cannot (shoul=
d not) be able to perform an XMLHttpRequest from his frontend to his backen=
d?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">If someone has the cookies to a website but=
 does not have a users password, can they still access the site?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">If subresource is really a problem, why not=
 let browser access any content without using any cookie? For example, if s=
ite A links site B, the browser will always request site B in some "incogni=
to mode", ignoring all previous authentations to site B? </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">If we were to redesign the web from scratch=
 now with security in mind would it be more secure? Or is a lot of this stu=
ff need time for bugs to be found and fixed? Has there been any work to red=
esign the web such that browser bugs don't compromise the security of the w=
ebsite?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">In the Ch.9 section "Security Policy for Co=
okies", the author writes that a common stateless way to avoid an attack ov=
erwriting a cookie with their own copy of the cookie is to store a secret t=
oken in a client-side cookie and then in a hidden form field and compare th=
e two. My question is why does this technique fail? My guess was either tha=
t the attacker could just include this secret key in their new cookie if it=
 is accessible through the site's html or that the attacker could overwrite=
 both if they are both stored in the client side.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Internet Explorer seems to be the most vuln=
erable browser. Are there reasons this is the case? Do they have a differen=
t security model when it comes to web security?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is SOP enforced by the web application deve=
loper or the browser? I was always under the impression that the browser so=
lved this problem for us.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is `document.domain` secure? If I see that =
login.bank.com sets `document.domain =3D "bank.com"`, can I just set `docum=
ent.domain =3D "bank.com"` on my own webpage too and then have access to th=
e DOM of login.bank.com? It didn't mention this in the reading, but does `d=
ocument.domain` have some check that your page is actually `*.some_domain` =
before it lets you set `document.domain =3D some_domain`?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is backporting typically a problem with web=
 security updates/innovations? The paper mentions several security features=
 that were not backported to earlier versions of Internet Explorer.=20

Even if the web browser (client) is updated to support most recent security=
 features, whether those security features will be utilized depends if a pa=
rticular web server can support them, right? That is, when communication be=
tween client/server is established, the security settings put in place for =
that communication are the minimum supported by both? </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is document.domain used in practice?  How d=
o developers deal with the problem that it ties the security of a given web=
page to the weakest linked page? </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is there a better security standard in mode=
rn browsers, or are
policies still as varied as they were in 2012?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is there a reason why Internet Explorer doe=
s not address the various security problems outlined in the chapters when a=
ll the other browsers do?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is there anything that restricts cookies to=
 protocols?=20
	e.g. Any cookie that is https will not respond to http requests.</pre></li=
>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">It is not clear to me how the secure flag w=
orks. It enforces encryption - so then both the browser and the server
have keys that they must use to decrypt and so on? What happens when this c=
ookie is sent in another HTTP request? Is the encrypted
cookie sent, and other servers would never be able to know what it is?

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">It seems like it's practically impossible t=
o get web security right, with so many different avenues for attack and dif=
ferent functionality on different websites. What would be your reccomendati=
ons on navigating this mess of features and their potential drawbacks?</pre=
></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">It seems like many of the issues addressed =
in these chapters were never actually fixed due to outdated browsers / diff=
erences in web browsers. In the years since have there been any attempts to=
 standardize browsers or get them all up to date so that security issues ca=
n be better addressed.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">It seems like plugins have incredible power=
 over a user. Does Google or any other browser do any security verification=
s on plugins?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">It seems like there are problems everywhere=
=EF=BF=BDso we could assume that there=EF=BF=BDs probably something wrong w=
ith any website/web app?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">It seems like there is a lot that goes on i=
n creating a secure website / web application, especially if you have a com=
plex setup with users, their credentials, etc. Are there good frameworks to=
 use, as a developer, that incorporate some of the good security practices =
outlined in =E2=80=9CThe Tangled Web=E2=80=9D? I understand not everything =
is possible, because different functionality requirements will need differe=
nt security design, but I=E2=80=99m wondering if there exist (and if people=
 use) frameworks for the basics.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">It seems like treating authentication cooki=
es like regular files is a big problem. Major holes like being able to acce=
ss the cookie through the DOM, or overflow the cookie jar and reset all the=
 cookies just don't make cookies seem like a viable way of authenticating u=
sers. Why isn't there more browser-side support for a secure cookie enclave=
 that would allow for things like strict domain scoping?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">It seems that Internet Explorer did not pro=
tect against as many vulnerabilities
as Chrome or Firefox. Did Microsoft's Edge browser make substantial advance=
s
to catch up in terms of security?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">It seems to me that creating a secure web a=
pp should not require the average developer to read an entire book to have =
a fighting chance at creating a secure web app. Do you believe this problem=
 of complexity is more inherent to the complexity of web apps, or instead t=
hat it's a product of the gradual evolution of web browsers/etc?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Lecture 13 (Question About Paper)

The same origin policy seems too permisive. Wouldn't it be easier if each J=
avaScript execution context was given one DOM it was allowed to modify (the=
 HTTP file that loaded the JavaScript initially). What's the advantage of a=
llowing JavaScript execution contexts to modify several DOMs?

I'm not sure what type of attack the secure flag is supposed to protect aga=
inst. Is it just designed to prevent an attacker who is eavesdropping on th=
e communication channel from reading the cookie?

Cookies and =E2=80=9CLegitimate=E2=80=9D DNS Hijacking:
I didn't understand how an attacker could do someting malicious by exploiti=
ng an advertising site provided by an ISP. What type of attack could he con=
duct?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Lecture 13: My Tangled Web Chapters 9-11 Qu=
estion

Is there a way to prevent cookie jar overflows?

Thank you!
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Lecture 13: Web Security Model
4/2/18

The paper says that by overwriting the cookie with the attackers, they can =
monitor activity such as searches or purchases. Does this mean that all htt=
p requests and communication between the user and server will be monitored =
by the attacker, and perhaps even unecrypted user information such as passw=
ords?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Maintaining the SOP seems like a process th=
at is very error-prone since bugs are mostly dynamically detected. What kin=
ds of frameworks and tools help web developers check that they are using th=
e right practices?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Many security vulnerabilities seem related =
to shortcomings in javascript API's and developers' lack of understanding o=
f these API's. Is there a way to separate the issue of isolation webpages f=
rom details of the javascript language? </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Mozilla's CSP is another layer of defense t=
o help protect users from a variety of attack vectors such as XSS and other=
 forms of content injection attacks. While it=E2=80=99s not a silver bullet=
, it does help make it considerably more difficult for an attacker to injec=
t content and exfiltrate data. Are there any better standards implemented b=

"Internet service providers that have relied on this practice include Cable=

ely, their approach is not only morally questionable, but it also creates a=
 substantial security risk. If the advertising site contains any script inj=

 other domain simply by accessing the vulnerable functionality through an a=

A lot of what is mentioned in the reading seems to be that different browse=
rs implement common-sense checks in different ways. So, as a security analy=
st in a corporation, is it industry practice to have individual teams be fo=
cused on one browser/applciation technology as it seems that writing common=
 security logic across different platforms leads to disastrous bugs (for ex=
ample, cookie scoping).

Also, do most security teams try to make their security solutions backwards=
 compatible so that users using older browsers can still make use of their =
sofware securely?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Suppose you are helping the developers of a=
 complex web site at http://bitdiddle.com/ to evaluate their security. This=
 web site uses an HTTP cookie to authenticate users. The site developers ar=
e worried an adversary might steal the cookie from one of the visitors to t=
he site, and use that cookie to impersonate the victim visitor.

What should the developers look at in order to determine if a user's cookie=
 can be stolen by an adversary? In other words, what kinds of adversaries m=
ight be able to steal the cookie of one of the visitors to http://bitdiddle=
.com/, what goes "wrong" to allow the adversary to obtain the cookie, and h=
ow might the developers prevent it?

Note: an exhaustive answer might be quite long, so you can stop after about=
 5 substantially-different issues that the developers have to consider.

There exist a multitude of exploits available to target users on the web. S=
ome security pitfalls may be prevented by only supporting certain browsers,=
 such as Chrome and Firefox, while purposely not supporting browsers such a=
s Internet Explorer. The adversary may steal the cookie through cross-site =
framing, proving same origin without truly being of the same origin, embedd=
ing malicious code in stylesheets, stealing the cookie when the user visits=
 another page and hijacking the frame.</pre></li>

Because of this risk, and following a lot of trial and error, modern browse=
