<h1> 6.858: Answers for lecture 14 </h1>

<ul>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">It seems to me that most things can be hand=
led by encryption, firewalls, smart DOS detectors, etc.

The attacks in the paper all relevant in the sense that people still think =
about about these attacks and are concerned if adversaries manage to pull t=
hem off, but it seems like people have come up with ways to either mitigate=
 the damage (encrypting packets so MITM scenarios aren't bad) or make it ve=
ry very hard to pull off the attacks in the paper.

Some things that still seem to be a concern are DNS-related attacks, but I'=
m not sure what the current status of DNSsec is...

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">* What problems still exist
TCP sequence number prediction is still an issue. As described in the paper=
 no modern technology could completely mitigate it. Given the attacker can =
reach the target server, the attacker just needs to know, guess or find out=
 the sequence number at some point. Since the sequence number at some time =
in the future is deterministic, the attacker can then pretend to be a trust=
ed host since they can guess the sequence number the server sent to the tru=
sted host.
The paper discusses routing protocols such as RIP and EGP. If servers still=
 use these outdated protocols they are vulnerable to the attacks discussed.
The ICMP attacks presented in the paper are still relevant in relation to D=
DoS attacks because as long as a target allows a connection from the attack=
er it must process ICMP packets in some way even if it just ignores them. T=
his means that given a sufficient number of packets ICMP is still a current=
 problem in some cases meaning administrators must secure against certain m=
essages in some way. In terms of routing information those attacks are like=
ly irrelevant as some sort of authentication likely occurs in order to prev=
ent routing information overwrites. The paper also discusses that these rou=
ting messages may not even be useful in vulnerable situations.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">- DDOS attacks are still a problem, althoug=
h they're more mitigated by CDNs.
- TCP/IP sequence attacks haven't been solved.
- Authentication servers aren't secure, such as those used in emails.
- Systems built on humans are vulnerable to social engineering attacks.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">- DOS attacks still valid threats.
- Various forms of sequence prediction attacks are still being found. I'm g=
uessing these protocols have not been rigorously proved.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">- TCP sequence number attacks
- Routing protocol attacks in order to eavesdrop/modify packets
- Email phishing
- DNS cache contamination attacks</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">- TCP sequence number prediction is still r=
elevant today.=20
- RIPv1 is now deprecated, so using RIPv2 with authentication is more safe =
against RIP attacks.=20
- EGP is no longer relevant since EGP has been replaced by BGP, but BGP is =
susceptible to attacks (BGP hijacking).=20
- Source routing is not really relevant since source routing is almost alwa=
ys disabled in ipv4.
- Email authentication and encryption are still very relevant problems toda=
y. Phishing is a vulnerability.
- DNS is still widely used and thus relevant to security today.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">- TPC sequence number attacks are still an =
issue.
- DDoS attacks are still issue, although things like large CDNs have helped
  mitigate the risks to small servers.
- DNS still isn't secure; cache contamination attacks are still an issue.
- Since BGP is still used it's still possible to advertise bogus routes, et=
c.
  to mount routing attacks.
- Phishing attacks can still happen over TCP/IP, of course (the author talk=
s
  about phishing attacks-- I'm unsure whether it's appropriate to call them=
 a
  TCP/IP issue, though).
- Session hijacking is still an issue, although common methods of HTTP cook=
ie
  theft are mitigated quite a lot by modern web frameworks.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">- allowing flooding attacks
- inside attacks not being defended against by firewalls
- routing attacks by intersecting packets and sending packets spoofed as be=
ing a known host
-spam email attacks: some with similar hosts like paypa1 and other just ran=
dom ones
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">- flooding the port with packets in the for=
m of DoS attacks
- Routing attacks
- Email phising
- DNS authentication</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">1. A lot of the issues with setting up conn=
ections are being addressed with SSL, so it seems any issues have moved to =
a different protocol.=20

2. I'm not sure if routing today is any more secure. I would assume that th=
e identities of good servers are very well known and routing tables don't c=
hange very often.

3. Mail is still an issue. I don't think there are any standard ways to sec=
ure it. Instead individual email service providers have developed their own=
 solutions. Email is encrypted on their individual networks and spam is fil=
tered out with heuristics. So assuming people are ok with the "centralizati=
on" of email, I guess you could say that this problem is solved for the lay=
 person. Of course given the publicity of email hacks perhaps having email =
tied to so many other accounts is a huge detriment and a separate system wo=
uld be better.

4. I don't know much about the security of DNSSec but I have heard of it be=
ing used today.

5. Denial of Service attacks are still a large issue. I don't think they ca=
n ever be solved, since servers exist to process requests, but there are "l=
oopholes" in protocols that make DoS attacks easier to launch and these hav=
e been patched, or are known.

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">1. Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
2. Authentication Server
3. Email protocols
4. Authentication
5. Encryption
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">1. The TCP/IP protocol suites today still u=
se addresses to identify machines, and these can easily be faked by hackers=
.
2. Implementation issue are likely still a source of security vulnerabiliti=
es having to do with the TCP/IP protocol suite.
3. The protocol still permits denial of service attacks.
4. It is still possible to use fake source addresses, although this is less=
 of an issue today.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">1. guessing the initial sequence number use=
d to establish a TCP connection between two servers (no longer an issue bec=
ause cryptographic methods)
2. queue overflows caused by flooding a server to cause connection messages=
 to be lost
3. netstat listed open ports on the machine and current connections, giving=
 the attacker a lot of info (no longer an issue)
4. address based authentication is very vulnerable to attack
5. denial of service attack needing 2^17 tries to guess the receive window =
of a packet
6. abuse of IP source routing
7. routing information protocol attacks - typically, the routing informatio=
n received is unchecked. attack is to claim a route to an unused host, inst=
ead of the network, and then all packets would be sent to attacker.
8. impersonate an exterior gateway
9. The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is the basic network manage=
ment tool of the TCP/IP protocol suite. Redirect attack=20
10. Authentication Servers (prob no longer an issue)
11. Finger protocol (firewalls protect against this)
12. Email not being encrypted (no longer an issue)
*******13. Spammers and phishers are still an issue today. This is because =
Authentication can prove identity, but not whether someone should be able t=
o send you an email.
*******14. DNS malicious behavior is also still an issue, and DNS servers a=
re a large target.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">6.858 - TCP/IP

- The TCP Prediction attack looks like it's still applicable, as I found re=
cent
  (within the last year) articles on the internet, and seems like it could =
be
  an issue for servers not aware of the attack.

- Source Routing is still an issue in the modern day, as it is a useful fea=
ture
  for communications but hard to detect.

- Systems that rely partially on human security (email phising attacks, POP=
, etc.)
  still happen because people are gullible, probably.

- I don't think DNS has changed dramatically in the last decade, so it's al=
so vultnerable
  to the attacks described in the paper
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">A TCP sequence prediction attack can still =
occur, though may encounter some obstacles.
Routing attacks are now much harder to feasibly pull off due to some of the=
 implemented protections mentioned in the article, such as firewalls.
Use of authentication servers is much less frequent now and so this attack =
is less likely to work.
The "finger" service is still an especially large problem today, as it is p=
ossible to amass large amounts of data on a user by looking at their online=
 public profiles.
DNS is still insecure, as not everyone runs DNSSEC, which too does not solv=
e all problems. However, there is current progress towards reducing the imp=
act of such an attack.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">A common motif in designing computer system=
s is to first focus on designing something
that's functional. It is only after you get it working that you start focus=
ing on=20
other ornaments, particularly security. The Internet routing problem follow=
ed this=20
pattern, thus routing attacks are still relevant today.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">All spoofing attacks that capitalize on the=
 lack of source address verification are still prevalent and relevant today=
, such as ARP spoofing, RIP spoofing (although handled in RIPng), ICMP spoo=
fing, DNS and ICMP amplification attacks. It is also common for local netwo=
rks to be vulnerable - such as Ethernet networks, are especially vulnerable=
 to eavesdropping and
host-spoofing due to lax physical access control.=20

Networks that implement network-level authentication (NLA) are not suscepti=
ble to such attacks. For example, the IPsec extension suite was developed i=
n part to counter such attacks by authenticating at the machine level using=
 AH (Authentication Headers). IPsec is part of the packet header for IPv6, =
so it is easier for IPv6 network admins to implement as compared to IPv4 ne=
tworks, which is comparably more cumbersome to implement such NLA using an =
extension like IPsec-IKE-ISAKMP due to potential issues such as address tra=
nslation challenges (NAT).</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Although EGP attacks can't happen anymore, =
BGP attacks are still relevant. </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">As mentioned in the paper =E2=80=9CThe Inte=
rnet of 1989 was a much simpler=E2=80=94and much friendlier=E2=80=94place t=
han it is today.=E2=80=9D I=E2=80=99m sure the same holds for the Internet =
at the time this paper was written and today! The following a list of some =
of the security problems described and whether or not they are still releva=
nt (i.e. unresolved or resolved issues):

- TCP sequence number attacks: resolved (solution in comments in section 2)
- Routing:
	- Source routing: resolved
	- RIP attacks: unresolved
	- EGP: became BGP, unresolved
	- ICMP: resolved
- Authentication server: resolved (modernized and used today=E2=80=A6)
- Finger service: unresolved
- Email: resolved

- FTP: unresolved
- SNMP: unresolved
- Remote Booting: resolved (DHCP authentication protocol)
- ARP attacks: unresolved</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Attacks on the Domain Name System (DNS), su=
ch as denial of service and cache contamination, are still relevant today.<=
/pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Attacks still relevant today:
- DoS attacks in general - the remote booting attack in particular seems li=
ke a problem we might still face today, along with broadcasting attacks
- MITM eavesdropping of routing packets - depending on the network, could p=
ossibly still eavesdrop on unencrypted data or learn passwords and other se=
nsitive info via side channel attacks (side channel attacks not mentioned i=
n paper)
- the describe all sorts of routing problems .. I'm not sure how many would=
 be solved today, but I feel like w/ the rise of IoT and ad hoc wireless ne=
tworks, we're facing a lot of similar issues regarding route planning and a=
uthentication
- the paper discusses DNS vulnerabilities .. I'm not familiar enough with t=
he protocols operating today but I feel like this might still be a problem?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Attacks that are still relevant today inclu=
des TCP package sequence number prediction, IP source routing, routing info=
rmation protocol attacks, fake authentication servers etc.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Authentication servers and addressed based =
authentication still seem relevant today. Some apps may have trusted ip add=
resses, which can then be abused if the ip address is the main authenticati=
on method for that peice of software. I think private/public key authentica=
tion does go a decent way to solving this, or using SSL for authentication.=
 I also don't think that email has been secured since the paper was written=
, i.e. encryption of message and header, and authentication of sender.</pre=

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Basically every vulnerability is still plau=

Lecture 14

Question:

Steve Bellovin's ``A Look Back'' paper was published in 2004, over 10 years=
 ago (and the paper itself is a retrospective on his earlier paper from 198=
9). Which of the security problems in the TCP/IP protocol suite described i=
n Steve Bellovin's paper are still relevant today?

Answer:

A few are: sequence number prediction attacks, firewalls don't protect agai=
nst insider attacks, DoS, authentication servers being
run by incompetent hosts, phishing, DNS resolver sequence number attacks, g=
eneral issues with encrypting messages.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Denial of Service attacks still exist in a =
number of scenarios.
DNS Cache poisoning attacks persist where an invalid response is sent for a=
 DNS query
BGP route hijacks are a common occurence - both arising from misconfigurati=
ons as well as intentional route hijacking
Many systems still use source routing - like ToR and onion routing protocol=
s leaving them suscpectible to the attacks discussed here
Email spam and hijacking still occurs despite increased authentication incl=
uding 2FA.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">DoS attacks, routing attacks (including BGP=
), lack of email authorization, DNS spoofing, ARP spoofing, rogue DHCP serv=
ers, DHCP info leaking, misconfiguration/buggy implementation, password gue=
ssing</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Electric Mail Spamming using fake email add=
resses is still an issue today. Use of POP3 and IMAP4 without encryption ma=
y be subject to man-in-the middle attacks. Finally an attack on the DNS ser=
ver can provide the attacker with means of supplying a subverted machine's =
IP address to any incoming requests. </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Email are still not authenticated (fake ema=
il addresses can still be used by spammers, although you cant send email fr=
om an email you don't own)
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Email is very vulnerable to attacks, even t=
oday. DNS attacks are possible still since it does not authenticate anyone.=
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Finger-like services like whois, social net=
works, and google still provide personal details that may exploit the wides=
pread adoption of plain passwords. The issue of email spam and trusted send=
ers is still an issue. DNS reflection, rebinding and cache poisoning attack=
s are still pretty common. Widely adopted DNS services still have poor priv=
acy.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Firewalls are still in use today, but as th=
e paper states, should be used with caution.
There's still problems with email and phishing.
Very similar DNS attacks still exists I believe.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Here are three which I looked into or have =
seen recently:

 - TCP sequence prediction is less relevant in the last decade, since imple=
mentations now generally generate secure unpredictable sequences (https://s=
ecurity.stackexchange.com/questions/34427/tcp-sequence-prediction-and-its-p=
rominence-in-modern-systems-networks).

 - Routing attacks are still relevant today. A variety of attacks around 20=
09: https://www.networkworld.com/article/2272520/lan-wan/six-worst-internet=
-routing-attacks.html. An attack on Bitcoin mining pools using "BGP hijacki=
ng" as recently as 2014: https://www.wired.com/2014/08/isp-bitcoin-theft/ (=
attacker gained access to a staff user account at a Canadian ISP broadcaste=
d a spoofed command that redirected traffic)

 - DNS attacks are still very relevant: i.e., I recently saw an article on =
DNS cache poisoning (https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/800113 and http://unix=
wiz.net/techtips/iguide-kaminsky-dns-vuln.html). </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I think a lot of these security problems ar=
e still relevant today such as routing and authentication issues. There are=
 attempts like Kerberos to improve security, but doesn=EF=BF=BDt completely=
 solve it.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I think some of the problems can now be par=
tially prevented using SSL.
However, some of the problems are still relevant today. Those include
denial of service attacks, ARP attacks and routing attacks.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Insider attacks that firewalls can't protec=
t against, routing attacks, Password-guessing attacks based on information =
made public about users online, email authorization/encryption, and many DN=
S attacks
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">It seems that many of the problems mentione=
d in the protocol suite would still be a problem today. As TCP was not init=
ially designed very securely, as even the creators
noted that use of the TCP sequence numbers as security was ill-advised, tho=
se relying on purely TCP for security will not be happy with the many probl=
ems that exist
with the protocol. One of the core problems mentioned by the paper, the aut=
hentication of the sender and receiver, remains a problem today. In additio=
n, solutions to
the problems mentioned in the paper exist, but are the solutions are not un=
iversally implemented nor when implemented, implemented correctly. </pre></=
li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">It seems that the security problems that ar=
e still relevant today are:
- TCP sequence numbers (perhaps prediction is hard, but security is still n=
ot assured)
- source routing -&gt; firewalls do not defend against insider attacks
- authentication servers -&gt; primary use is auditing and not authenticati=
on, but the security vulnerability still exists
- e-mail -&gt; endpoints are not secure</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Jun Wan 991032935

1. TCP Sequence Number Prediction Attack:=20
   (1) If you know the sequence numbers of an active session, you can hijac=
k it.
   (2) The r-utilities are implicitly relying on TCP sequence numbers.
   (3) The defense scheme has not been widely adopted. Instead, many implem=
entations use random ISNs or (especially) random increments. This has obvio=
us negative effects on the correctness of TCP in the presence of duplicate =
packets.

2. Routing Information Protocol Attack: this attack abuses the routing prot=
ocols for eavesdropping and/or packet modification. While there are proposa=
ls to solve this problem, nothing has been implemented; all of the proposed=
 solutions have their drawbacks.

3. Authentication Server: The authentication server was a bad idea which is=
 still used today.

4. Email Authentication: There is still no widely-deployed method of authen=
ticating email. Authentication proves an identity, but it says nothing of w=
hether or not that party is authorized to send you email.

5. Denial of Service: still a crucial weak spot.

6. Address Resolution Protocol Attack: In 2004, ARP attacks still work in w=
ireless networks. It can also be used to defeat the presumed security prope=
rties of Ethernet switches. I am not sure whether this still works nowadays=
.</pre></li>

I think source routing, although almost deprecated in most systems, is stil=
l a vulnerability if any system supports it.=20
A RIP attack can also happen in the current TCP/IP protocol but there are m=
uch more defenses against it now.
Faking email sources and phishing is still a huge issue. Most small scale e=
mail service clients don't encrypt or authenticate.
DoS attacks launched by spoofing DNS requests is still a security issue.

From my understanding DNS is still a huge hole in a secure internet. DNS ac=
ts as
a distributed DB, but the nodes and data in the DB are not crptographically
secure, and can be spoofed by the right adversary. In fact, very recently I=
've
read articles pushing for DNS to happen over TLS so that it is encrypted at=
 the
very least. Optimally, a cryptographically secure solution such as DNSSEC o=
r
perhaps even a blockchain based solution.=20

The paper talks specifically about DNS cache contamination attacks, which c=
an be
used to have DNS resolve different IPs to some host names.

Steve Bellovin's ``A Look Back'' paper was published in 2004, over 10 years=
 ago (and the paper itself is a retrospective on his earlier paper from 198=

It seems like TCP sequence number prediction attacks, source routing attack=
s, and others can be prevented by updating the software running on servers,=
 however, it doesn't seem like there are many solutions for DoS attacks. Fo=
r example, I read about the Shrew DoS attack in some lecture notes from Pur=

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Man-in-the-middle attacks with various form=

most unlimited control over the network. End-to-end encryption is much more=
 common today, but not at the low levels (IP layer) examined in the paper. =
Denial-of-service attacks are also common today, but they often rely on sen=

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Many of the security problems are still rel=

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Many of these protocols are now secure enou=

written in the paper are irrelevant today.

DNS is still used for some man in the middle attacks, and DoS attacks can s=
till
occur via most of these protocols.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Many of these specific attacks are no longe=

are still relevant today. However, in general it is very difficult to patch=
 a

that it can't be changed too drastically without interfering with tons of
existing systems.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Most of the attacks in the paper are releva=
nt today, but can be mitigated, since today we have encryption and cryptogr=
aphic signatures. In particular,

- DNS spoofing and cache poisoning isn't going to work because our browsers=
 will check the certificate of the website, and ignore a fradulent website =
that is posing as a legitimate one.

- Passwords cannot be collected on TCP because passwords are always encrypt=
ed via SSL.

- End to end encryption guarantees that any data that is intercepted along =
the links is unreadable to the attacker.

- Cryptographic signatues on messages guarantee the integrity of the data. =
The attacker cannot spoof a message because changing any bits invalidates t=
he signature. In addition, replay attacks are prevented by including the se=
quence number in the signature.

- Email can also be encrypted end to end, and can be verified via PGP key s=
igning and SPF records. However, it is still possible to spoof email addres=
ses, and users may fall victim to phishing attacks if they only look at the=
 sender (From: ) field and not the specific headers in the message.

- We have SCP, which is more secure than FTP.

- DOS attacks are still relevant today, and though load balancers and CDNs =
try to mitigate that, it still poses somewhat of a problem.

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Most of the issues that the author pointed =
in the Retrospective conclusion are still prelevant today - guessability, r=

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Most vulnerabilities might be still availab=

However, since TCP/IP is not designed to=20

and hard to fix. 1. TCP sequency number vulnerability,
attacker might either steal or predict the sequency=20
number to impersonate a host. 2. IP, source routing.
The attacker can change the routing path and read the

FTP is hard to secure but from my understanding, FTP
is not as popular as it is before. </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">One can use TCP sequence number prediction =

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Paper Question

1. Spoofing attacks that make use of missing SAV (source address verificati=
on) are common in today's security paradigms. If the receiver does not veri=
fy who they are talking to, a malicious agent can make use of TCP to send m=
alicious commands to the machine.=20

2. MITM attacks are also still a problem where on local networks a maliciou=

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Potential Issues that still exist today (or=
 don't):

- TCP number prediction; It's not clear that anyone has implemented Bellovi=
n's proposed solution. As a result, presumably protocols still "rely on TCP=
 sequence numbers for security."
- Source Routing attacks; these seem to be mostly taken care of via firewal=
ls, unless the attacker is an inside the gateways, in which case this could=
 still be a problem.
- RIP exploits: According to Bellovin, this remains a problem without a rea=
sonable solution. Simple defenses include filtering out bogus addresses and=
 authentication of RIP packets. However, these aren't often used.
- EGP exploits: No longer a problem, as EGP has been replaced with BGP. How=
ever, BGP has its own, larger set of vulnerabilities.
- ICMP exploits: easily corrected and not really a problem anymore accordin=
g to Bellovin.
- Authentication server based exploits: not really a problem anymore, as on=
ly used for auditing, not authentication.
- finger services: guessing a password to get user metadata is, according t=
o Bellovin, an effective attack.
- Email: Phishing remains still an effective attack.
- DNS exploits: DNS problems still remain. Specifically, it is possible to =
create fake DNS entries, and read entire DNS mappings to search for vulnera=
bilities.
- FTP is still a problem; cannot secure FTP data channels, and and arbitrar=
y FTP server can *bounce* to third host, resulting in an attack upon them.
- SNMP remains vulnerable because plain text passwords are bad.
- RARP and TFTP have been replaced with DHCP, which is worse if the adversa=

Answer: One specific problem Bellovin talked about in his paper was routing=
 attacks. There are still many IP spoofing attacks that are used for things=
 like DDoS attacks. It doesn't help that certain protocols like BGP aren't =
well equipped to deal with these problems, so it is necessary to iterate. T=

Many of the problems with the TCP/IP protocol suite have been "solved" eith=

quence-number attacks are still possible due to ACK packets being returned =
even if r-utilities rejects source-routed connections.  BGP is also still q=

1. TCP sequence number attacks are somewhat from the past, since modern ope=

3. RIP-based attacks can still be valid. RIP often stays enabled in the net=

4. EGP. I believe, this protocol was replaced by BGP, therefore, the relate=

6. Mail protocols are still leaving plenty of doors for attacks.

7. There's no list which can be longer and more dangerous than a list of DN=
S attacks.

8. FTP - it's an insecure protocol which is still widely used.

9. SNMP - even the use of SNMP v3 doesn't guarantee security.=20

10. DHCP attacks are still relevant. DHCP starvation &amp; and spoofing.=20

Though there have been some recent extensions of the DNS system (like DNSSE=

mind.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">TCP sequence number prediction, including i=

TM attacks), is still a problem, but mostly weakened by the growing standar=
ds.
Many tools mentioned in the software such as "r-utilities" are now crypto p=
rotected so they are more secure in this sense.
DDoS is still apparently relevant.=20
The case mentioned in the paper where some attacker simulates a server in m=
aintainence, should be irrelavent in today's setting(though I'm not sure ex=
actly how).=20
Source Routing is mostly vulneralbe with address based authentication. I th=
ink the convention today have pretty well assumptions when information shou=
ld be user authentaticated.=20
EGP related attacks seems quite rare these days.
Routing tabel attacks is also one possibility today.
DNS attacks are still prevalent today, especially when organized attacks ar=
e in the picture.
The attacks mentioned about FTP are more or less a file system permission r=
elated problem, for example, care needs to be taken when certain file shoul=
d not be leaked when setting up the FTP routes. </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">TCP sequence prediction attacks are still r=
elevant today -- secure schemes are either incorrectly implemented, not wid=
espread, or not performant enough. Routing attacks for eavesdropping and pa=
cket modification are also relevant, even if by accident. Finally, the pape=
r claims that DNS remainds a crucial weak spot in the Internet; not only is=
 address-based authentication already weak, many implementations of the pro=

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">TCP/IP has retained a lot of it's previous =
problems even today - we continue to build on this system design despite th=

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The ICMP attacks used for Denial of Service=
 are now protected against. The TCP/IP sequence number guessing has also be=

DNS is also still vulnerable as DNSSEC still has issues.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The denial of service attacks that Bellovin=
 describes are still relevant today and (fairly) common. We also learned in=
 6.033 about how an ISP in Pakistan accidentally directed all Youtube traff=
ic to a "banned" page (since the Pakistan govt had blocked Youtube), and wh=
ile this instance wasn't an attack, it could have easily been one--so I gat=
her that routing attacks are still a problem. I also think that DNS attacks=
 remain common.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The first attack the paper mentions is rega=
rding ISN guessing. I think these attacks
still do exist, but are not as effective due to encryption and adding bits =
of randomness
to the SN_s

Next, the paper discusses many TCP routing attacks; most of these attacks a=
re probably
still relevant in current day as I think? routing protocol hasn't been chan=
ged much.=20
It's probably possible to encrypt all inter router communication, but it's =
probably not
true that this happens between all vulnerable routers.

The problem with authentication servers probably still exists; the attacker=
 is just=20
pretending to be the server.

DNS problems outlined are also probably still prevelant; because of the wid=
espread use
of the DNS system it's hard to make any big changes to it and have everyone=
 adapt them.
This means that it's more difficult to account for many problems such as ca=
che pollution
which would cause domain name resolution to resolve to a malicious server.


</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The papers concern about "address-based aut=

relevant now that the network itself is being viewed as increasingly malici=

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The security problems that still exist are =
the use of an authentication server, DNS vulnerabilities, anonymous FTP, an=

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The threat from insider attacks, the import=
ance of not trusting TCP for security, routing attacks that disturb global =
internet routing, services that provide large amounts of personal data on u=
sers upon request, email phishing, and attacks from the local network, are =
all still relevant.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">There are a fair number of attacks that are=

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">There are a few security problems in the TC=

hat have the same problem, e.g. DNS queries can be spoofed. SYN flooding is=
 also still a problem. SYN flooding and DOS (or DDOS) attacks are still app=
licabe if the server does not have a good protections plan or sufficient re=
sources for allocation (like Googe's security). A third persistent issue is=
 E-mail. How do we authenticate and verify the *identity* of users (not jus=

The security problems in the TCP/IP protocol suite that are still relevant =

2. source routing (these type of attacks are mostly prevented by firewalls,=
 except for insider attacks)
3. Routing Information Protocol Attacks (abusing the routing protocols for =

6. Attack a DNS server to spy on users</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">While some of the attacks described here ar=

BGP protocol are possible because ASes can advertise about prefixes they do=

actually own, similar to DNS. It's hard to fix these problems because the
protocols were not designed with security infrastructure in mind, so it is
difficult to add anything on top of them and have it widely accepted.

the multiple layers of protocols over routing. TCP sequence number attacks,=
 also described in the paper, is well described and known yet
