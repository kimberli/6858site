There's encryption and authentication, which can work for some
applications (e.g., TLS, SSH, etc).

But how would you do encryption or authentication for DHCP or ARP?
What keys should you encrypt with, or what key should you use to
authenticate?  How could you solve DoS attacks?  Not super clear.

      <div class=3D"responsebox"><pre class=3D"responsepre">It depends on w=
hat's going on in that malicious USB device.

One of the easier cases is, the malicious USB device is a regular USB
stick with a file system that contains some malware.  On Windows, you
may be able to safely access this USB drive by disabling autorun, so
that no code from the drive is executed when it's plugged in.  But, as
Paul Youn mentioned, in the stuxnet attack the attackers found that
Windows actually does some complex stuff to render the icon for the
USB drive and the files on it, so maybe it's hard to disable all
automatic code execution from the USB drive.  Or there might be bugs
in the file system implementation in Windows (or MacOSX) that are
triggered by the intentionally corrupted file system image stored on
the USB drive.

Unfortunately I don't know enough about Windows or MacOSX to
definitively say how to prevent Windows/MacOSX from running stuff on
the drive as soon as it's plugged on.  But that's basically what you'd
have to figure out to handle this easier case.

On the more extreme end, the device might contain two functions: a
perfectly legitimate USB storage device, and a USB keyboard (virtual,
of course) that types in malicious commands (like, open a command
prompt in Windows or shell in MacOSX and run some commands that make
the computer accessible to the attacker over the network).  By
default, the USB device exposes the benign USB storage interface.  But
if triggered (e.g., by time, or by RF signal, or by some file contents
that's written to the storage part), the device switches into this
malicious keyboard mode.

It seems pretty hard to detect the second kind of attack, and it's
probably not too hard to implement given access to the firmware
running on the USB drive's microcontroller.

There's actually an interesting paper about what to do with malicious
USB devices:

  http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~mwalfish/papers/cinch-usec16.pdf

One of the authors (Mike Walfish, who used to be a PhD student here at
MIT) now has a startup company, I believe, trying to commercialize
some kind of "USB protection" dongle that you can use to plug in
suspect USB devices into a computer relatively safely.

At an internet-wide scale, large-scale deployment of DDoS mitigation

On the local scale, more sophisticated logic in network switches /

rogue DHCP servers.

use; key management is not really defined, so you need a sophisticated
administrator to set up all of the keys for IPsec.  As a result, it's
used for large-scale site-to-site VPNs (e.g., connect two large
company offices over the internet, so that they can safely share their
internal network).  But it's not used for regular connections to, say,
amazon or google.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; On the local scale, more sophisticated logic in network switches /

&gt;&gt; Otherwise, not that much has changed at this low level.

Random increments have a higher likelihood of picking a nearby
sequence number again, compared to monotonically inrcementing ISNs.

Roughly yes, although it's BGP instead of RIP.

      <div class=3D"responsebox"><pre class=3D"responsepre">It used to be t=
he case that there was a netstat service: you could
"telnet foo.mit.edu netstat", and when some client connected to the
"netstat" port, the remote machine would run "netstat" and send the
output to the client!

Same for finger -- there is a finger service, which you could invoke
using, say, "finger @cvp.mit.edu".  There wasn't such a command for w.

so, isn't this still a security issue? I notice that the outpu of `netstat`=
 is substantially different than that describe in the paper. Is this indica=

&gt;
&gt; 2) The paper mentions the problematic nature of the `finger` utility, =
but doesn't seem to mention `w`, which provides substantially more material=

can't quite agree, and that's why you see weird sentences like what

&gt; I'm curious about the process by which internet standards like TCP/IP =
evolve.
&gt;
&gt; When following up on references from Bellovin's paper, I found the def=
inition
&gt; of the keywords MUST, SHOULD, etc. used in RFCs:
&gt; https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119
&gt;
&gt; I also noticed that an updated RFC regarding defending against sequenc=
e number
&gt; attacks (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6528, section 3) begins with '=
TCP
&gt; SHOULD generate its initial Sequence Numbers with the expression...'. =
The
&gt; recommendation involves computing using a cryptographic hash function =
to
&gt; compute the initial sequence number. This excerpt uses SHOULD instead =
of MUST.
&gt;
&gt; Later in this RFC, I found the phrase, 'Since MD5 is faster than other
&gt; "stronger" alternatives, and is used in virtually all existing impleme=
ntations
&gt; of this algorithm, we consider that use of MD5 in the specified algori=
thm is
&gt; acceptable.  However, implementations should consider the trade-offs i=
nvolved
&gt; in using functions with stronger security properties, and employ them =
if it is
&gt; deemed appropriate.'
&gt;
&gt; It seems there is a lot of flexibility in defining how paranoid or not=
, or how
&gt; strict or not (e.g. MUST vs SHOULD) the specification is made. I am wo=
ndering
&gt; how these choices are made, and who are the primary influencers of dec=
isions
&gt; like this. The RFC header states it was released for public review. Is=
 it
&gt; primarily internet researchers who review these standards? Is there of=
ten
&gt; contention around these standards? Do these standards differentially a=
ffect
&gt; different players---e.g. suppose company A made one historical choice =
and
&gt; company B made another, and suppose a standard was issued that meant c=
ompany A
&gt; would need to redesign a part of their infrastructure whereas company =
B would
&gt; not? I suppose the standards evolve slowly enough that this sort of th=
ing does
&gt; not happen?

"Bogus" here is a very specific meaning:
