<h1> 6.858: Questions for lecture 14 </h1>

<ul>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">1. Are RIP attacks still possible in today'=
s protocol? I have never heard of one that happened recently.
2. Can you also go a bit in detail about Subnet mask attacks?
3. Can you also go over the section "Remote Booting"?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">1. One confusing thing about this paper was=
 the diagrams that explained the
	 TCP sequence number prediction attacks. It may be obvious to other people=
,
	 but it wasn't obvious for me to see what packets/acks were being sent.
=09
2. "Defense against routing attacks must still be considered a research pro=
blem."
	 Since this paper was effectively published in 1989, what is the overall s=
tatus
	 of defending against routing attacks today? Is it still an active researc=
h problem?


</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">1. The author writes "AT&amp;T=E2=80=99s di=
al-up Internet service was knocked off the air for many hours when another =
ISP started advertising a route to a small, internal network." What is the =
connection between AT&amp;T getting knocked off air and another ISP adverti=
sing a route to a small, internal network?

2. How do ISPs protect against RIP attacks today?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">1. Today, is there any way for a gateway to=
 prove it can reach the endpoints it advertises it can reach in the routing=
 protocol?=20

2. Could you explain what he means when he says that priviledged ports are =
a bad idea? Does he mean that they should be priviledge separated, where ha=
ving the priviledge to one port means you cannot access another?


</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">6.858 - TCP/IP

- Are there famous cases where TCP prediction caused a serious issue with a=
n online
service? e.g. web connection disruption, spoofing the server, etc.

- I'm not very clear as to how finger can be used to give away data. For ex=
ample,
  on Athena's AFS system what can finger do that a security engineer would =
consider
  "giving away data"?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">AFAIK, the current solution to DDoS attack =
is using scalable systems that are simply able to absorb the attack. Howeve=
r, not a lot of web servers can afford such infrastructure. Has there been =
any recent advances in research in preventing DDoS attacks in other ways?</=
pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Are ARP and DHCP still a problem today? It =
seems like we can do pretty decently by just letting the switch be in charg=
e of them.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Are BGP attacks only a subset of the RIP at=
tacks? In what other settings do attacks akin to BGP route hijacking still =
take place?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Are TCP sequence number attacks still relev=
ant today? Have there been major
changes in the way that TCP sequence numbers are generated since 2004?=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Are any of these protocols/systems no longe=
r in use today?=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Are there better alternatives to the TCP/IP=
 protocol?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Are there proposals for authenticating a us=
er sending mail from an address? Or if a server recieves mail from another =
service, is there a way to authenticate the message from the source mail se=
rver?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Are these the methods present day hackers w=
ould still use to hack into systems? Are all of these defenses implemented?=
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Assuming that there is some difference from=
 the time this paper was published,
what are the most relevant network attacks today?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Could you explain in more detail the source=
 routing attack Bellovin talks about in section 3.1?
I understand the assumption he's making about a target host using the rever=
se of source route, and its motivation.
But I don't quite understand how that lets an attacker gain access to trust=
ed machines, perhaps because I'm missing some details about how routing wou=
ld happen in this scenario.

In a compact, haiku form:
3.1 describes
an attack using few words.
Could you provide more?</pre></li>

Lecture 14

The paper itself and the question for this paper show that there are obviou=
sly still quite a few problems remaining
from quite a while ago. What can be done, in general, to speed up the proce=
ss of fixing many these issues?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Do you think Cloudfare's encrypted DNS redu=
ces the attack surface of DNS significantly?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Does SFTP address the security problems in =
FTP?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Does publishing papers on all the vulnerabi=
lites act as a good resources for hackers to find new ways to exploit a sys=
tem? More than help people fix the problems since the vulnerabilities are n=
ot implementation bugs but protocol issues which would take more effort and=
 time to fix?

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">For sequence number guessing, why can't TCP=
 encrypt the counter for more security against guessing? </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Given how hackily everything is put togethe=
r, is there a push to eventually try to transition to a more cohesive, and =
safer protocol?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Has the author looked back on this paper (m=
aybe not as a direct response) and given an update as to how TCP/IP securit=
y has changed in the last 14 years?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Have there been proposed alternatives to TC=
P/IP that place a greater emphasis on security? Although clearly none have =
gained any sort of traction, is there some sort of "academic consensus" on =
more secure suggestions that may have been wiser choices for the basis of t=
he internet?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How are security improvements and new polic=
ies brought about? How are decisions made about changes in TCP/IP?</pre></l=
i>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How can TCP/IP stack expected to protect it=
self against exploitation when used with unsecure routing protocols set up =
by uncontrollable users?=20

At what point did encryption of messages and other data-leaking elements li=
ke the TCP handshake become mainstream?=20

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How come we never moved on from TCP and sta=
rted using some other protocol widely after decades?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How common are these "reflection" papers? I=
 would be interested in reading
others if they exist.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How common is it for third party authentica=
tion servers to be used nowadays for a client to authenticate itself to a s=
ervice. I haven't really heard of such a thing before.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How difficult is it to make a change to TCP=
/IP protocols? Does the difficulty mostly lie in backwards compatibility? <=
/pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How do BGP attacks happen in the real world=
?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How do most DNS servers today handle resour=
ce record requests? Are they still vulnerable to address spoofing if DNSsec=
 isn't implemented?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How do you detect compromises such as the o=
nes in the paper on idle machines in your network?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How do you go about instantiating an improv=
ed protocol across the internet? For example, DNSSEC has been deployed to m=
aybe ~20% of hosts despite being formulated 20 years ago.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How effective are bounty programs really, f=
or fixing security bugs?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How relevant do you think machine learning =
techniques are becoming in reducing DoS and spam compared to current securi=
ty techniques?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I am confused about the FTP attacks because=
 I am not as familiar with how that protocol works and how those attacks ar=
e orchestrated.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I had a hard time answering today's questio=
n because I don't have much
experience in the network security field outside of 6.033. What's an
approachable way to learn about these things (a news website or blog, etc.)=
?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I wonder how scalable are updates to intern=
et protocols. Consider the scenario in which they do discover a better way =
of=20
performing all the functions of TCP/IP, and they (inception-question: who a=
re they?) decide to update how it works.
What would need to change? Browsers are clearly a key thing in this, as are=
 any authorities involved in the routing. But
are there hardware level changes? Can the updates be delivered through the =
soon-to-change internet itself? How feasible is modifying the internet?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I'm interested in the IETF. Who makes up th=
e IETF? I know that the IETF deals with internet standards and things like =
TCP/IP, but their standards are supposedly voluntary, so what encourages th=
em to be adopted? What internet security-related things lie outside of the =
role of the IETF?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I'm mostly confused about TCP sequence numb=
er Predication. I'm still confused about why true random increment generati=
on versus pseudo random still doesn't fully solve the issue.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I'm not sure I understood how the "source r=
outing" attack described in section 3.1 works.=20
How is the attacker able to "pick any IP source address" and access any fac=
ilities of that
machine?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I've seen in the news very recently that Cl=
oudflare launched their own DNS at
  1.1.1.1. Their service has lower latency, and offers DNS or TLS.=20

Is DNS over TLS still vulnerable to cache contamination attacks? Do you nee=
d a
cryptographically secure system like DNSSEC to prevent it?

Also, I see that Cloudflare now offers DNSSEC as a service, but I dont
understand how thats possible if the rest of the internet doesn't use it?

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">If someone could hijack DNS servers they co=
uld destabilize the world. I'm sure there are more "doomsday" scenarios in =
existance. Are there plans in place for these kind of attacks?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">If someone has control of a network gateway=
 can they basically conduct a MITM attack on any website? Assuming they und=
erstand how the website they want to attack works. It would just seem like =
TCP packets are being dropped or delayed.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">In one of the past answers you say that ISP=
s don't have an incentive to prevent
DDOS attacks because they get paid to transmit any traffic. Is the payment
scheme really established like this? I thought ISPs were generally paid a f=
ixed
amount per month to provide a certain amount of network capacity (say a 100=
 Mb/s
connection). Given that their own networks tend to be oversubscribed, I'd e=
xpect
contributing to a large DDOS attack would lead to degraded service for thei=
r
other customers. Am I missing something?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">In regard to the section on finger, how hav=
e we spent 30 years giving
away user data at increasingly terrifying scales and only rarely
stopped to think about the consequences?  Do you think there will ever
be good solutions for balancing the ability to
socialize/communicate/share safe information easily, and the ability
to keep things private?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">In regards to trusted/encrypted emails, wha=
t are some of the leading factors that hindered mass adoption of schemes ad=
dressing this problem i.e. PGP
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">In the 15 years or so since the reprint of =
the original paper, have any more serious networking attacks risen? I'm gue=
ssing that CDN networks are also vulnerable to a range of attacks. </pre></=
li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">In the TCP connection messages in section 2=
, part of the message sometime includes =E2=80=9CSRC =3D T=E2=80=9D even th=
ough the source is X. How does X change its source (itself) such that it be=
comes T for these messages?

On page 4, it mentions =E2=80=9Canother solution to sequence number attacks=
: randomizing the increment.=E2=80=9D What was the previous solution? Opera=
ting the counter at a true rate of 250,000 Hz?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">In the edits the author made he mention tha=
t DNS vulnerabilites remain to be an issue due to the fact that an attacker=
 simply needs to lie to create a false record. Has filtering gotten better =
since he wrote this note in 2004? If so, what has been done to fix these is=
sues?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">In the paper, Bellovin mentioned the use of=
 TCP sequence numbers for the initialization vector for counter mode encryp=
tion. I looked it up, but I don't really understand what he's trying to say=
 here. Why would the sequence number be used for encryption? Was this a thi=
ng?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Instead of randomizing the increment for TC=
P sequence number, why is the "sequence" number not just randomized?</pre><=
/li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is it feasible that internal network attack=
s may go away as our network infrastructure changes? As people become incre=
asingly reliant on personal=20
computing devices and internet services become more robust, it seems like t=
he use cases for internal networks is largely becoming more about performan=
ce.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is routing information protocols (RIP) stil=
l used?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is source routing an issue if the attacker =
cannot read the packets (i.e if they are SSL-encrypted)?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is there a good reference for how routing g=
enerally works?  E.g., from the perspective of a computer trying to connect=
 to google.com, all the various players involved in establishing that conne=
ction?  I didn't fully grasp some of the details re: routing attacks in par=
ticular.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is there now a widely deployed method for a=
uthenticating email? There still seems to be ways for people to make emails=
 appear as though they were sent by someone else.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">It seems from this read that TCP/IP is not =
a secure layer.
Were the protocols for this layer conceived with the idea that upper layers=
 would take care of the security?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">It seems like DNS is a really big attack su=
rface that is also really vulnerable and valuable. Has there been any succe=
ssful research on how to actively make DNS more secure?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">It seems like the paper assumes the network=
 infrastructure (routers, switches, etc.) can generally be trusted to imple=
ment the protocols correctly. Why is this a safe assumption? Can there be a=
ny security guarantees in the presence of a rogue router?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">It seems that in 1989, email, DNS, and FTP =
was considered part of the "TCP/IP Protocol Suite", or why would section 5 =
discuss them otherwise, given the title of the paper? Is this classificatio=
n still made like this today?


</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">It seems that some of the vulnerable protoc=
ols described in the paper still exist because of the difficulty in rolling=
 out a replacement. Bellovin mentions this in regard to DNSsec, and I was w=
ondering if it is possible at this point to replace the protocols in this s=
uite with better versions, or if it is necessary to continue trying to patc=
h what is already there?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">It seems that the reason we still use these=
 old protocols is mostly due to their widespread use. Is there anyone at MI=
T working on secure protocols and changing to a more secure protocol around=
 the world?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">It's interesting to me that the most secure=
 systems that we've learned about in this class have come from large tech c=
ompanies, while systems that arise from consumers are far less organized an=
d secure. How much power does an organization like the IETF have over the a=
ctual protocols that are run on the internet? How difficult would it be for=
 a centralized task force like the IEFT to overhaul a protocol like ICMP? I=
t seems like improving the rate at which we can adopt new, better protocols=
 and abandon old, insecure protocols would do wonders for the security of t=
he Internet...</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Lecture 14
Out of the issues described in the paper, which is the most dangerous in to=
day's context?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Lecture 14 (Question About Paper)

Have there been any serious efforts to modernize the internet infrastructur=
e to deal with security issues? It seems like there have been lots of effor=
ts to add security features to a system that wasn't originally designed wit=
h security in mind, so there will always be loopholes.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Lecture 14: My TCP/IP Question

With so many vulnerabilities and threats, how is it that the whole system d=
idn't break down
completely at some point? And who exactly is in charge of measuring the sys=
tem's performance,
fixing bugs, and making the system more secure?

Thank you!
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Lecture 14: Network Security
4/9/18

This paper points out that using IP addresses as authentication is not a gr=
eat practice and is rather bug-prone, yet it seems rather necessary to one,=
 be backwards compatible if it does change, and two to easily navigate thro=
ugh the web with minimal overhead. Are there other ways beng explored today=
?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Looking at the paper's list of vulnerabilit=
ies, which do you see as (a) having the most impact due to its severity, an=
d (b) the hardest to fix?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Many of the security vulnerabilities descri=
bed in this paper result from security misconfigurations that are left to t=
he implementor or system admin to take care of (e.g. properly setting up an=
d monitoring firewalls, enabling encryption options in email/POP/IMAP). Hav=
e there been any steps to centralize network security upgrades as opposed t=
o leaving many features up to sysadmins to implement? (one example that com=
es to mind is IETF's DNSSEC which seems to have encountered slow deployment=
... is deployment typically an obstacle in centralizing development of new =
security features?)</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Modern websites rely on application level p=
rotocols to secure data. These protocols generally assume that TCP connecti=
ons are not reliable. Then are these security improvements on TCP protocol =
redundant? What's the threaten model to TCP/IP protocol? Specifically, what=
 security issues should be addressed on application level rather than TCP/I=
P level?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">My understanding is that CDNs such as Akama=
i and Cloudflare work by somewhat abusing the DNS protocol; when a site is =
served over a CDN, a DNS lookup for the site will return the address of an =
edge server located physically close to the client. This seems like it migh=
t violate some assumptions that were in place when DNS was originally desig=
ned (e.g. that a lookup for a given domain would always return the same IP =
address regardless of the client's location).

Violating the original assumptions behind a protocol often leads to securit=
y or interoperability issues, because code or infrastructure which relied o=
n those assumptions might stop working correctly. Has the presence of CDNs =
caused any significant problems along these lines?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Question about Paper

What network level authentication mechanisms are commonly used in industry =
to prevent source address verification attacks? </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Question: Are there alternative protocol to=
 TCP which have looked promising from a security standpoint or which have g=
ained any traction or adoption in the last few decades? </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Question: Would it be feasible for TCP/IP t=
