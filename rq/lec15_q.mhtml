<h1> 6.858: Questions for lecture 15 </h1>

<ul>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">What are some current security issues with =
SSL?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text"> What stops an attacker from dropping the f=
ixed bytes set in the PKCS padding that attempt to stop downgrade attacks?

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">" In practice, users typically consider the=
 threat of this kind of coarse-grained tracking to be relatively harmless, =
so SSL does not attempt to stop this kind of traffic analysis. Ignoring coa=
rse-grained traffic analysis seems like a reasonable design decision."

Where is the point where users start to care about their traffic being anal=
yzed, particularly in light of the recent Facebook scandal? As in, where do=
es "coarse-grained" become "fine-grained"?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">"A wide variety of strong algorithms used i=
n standard modes is available to suit local preferences; reasonable applica=
tions should be able to find an encryption algorithm meeting the required l=
evel of security, US export laws permitting."

What export laws are they talking about?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">"SSL will provide a lot of known plaintext =
to the eavesdropper ... the encryption algorithm is required to be strong a=
gainst known-plaintext attacks" - what is this known plaintext, why is a lo=
t of it provided, and what sort of attacks are made using it against which =
the encryption algorithm has to be strong?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">"SSL will provide a lot of known plaintext =
to the eavesdropper, but there seems to be no better alternative; since the=
 encryption algorithm is required to be strong against known-plaintext atta=
cks anyway, this should not be problematic."

So known-plaintext attacks are attacks where the adversary has access to bo=
th the plaintext and
the encrypted version. If SSL already encrypts the text, why does it also s=
end the plaintext over
the network?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">"The SSL 2.0 protocol has become a de facto=
 standard for cryptographic protection of Web http traffic."

Does HTTP also use SSL? I thought only HTTPS used SSL...

Also, why does the RSA key exchange support the random PKCS padding, and wh=
y does Diffie-Helman key exchange not support it?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">- How does SSL 3.0 prevent the following at=
tack: Suppose the list of supported ciphersuites in the hello message of th=
e client contains a weak and a strong ciphersuite, and the hello message of=
 the server contains the same two ciphersuites, and both the client and the=
 server send a "change cipher spec" message indicating that they want to us=
e the strong ciphersuite, but the man in the middle replaces these two mess=
ages by "change cipher spec" messages indicating that they want to use the =
weak cipher suite. It seems that this attack would be possible because the =
"change cipher spec" messages are not authenticated in the "finished" messa=
ge. What am I missing?
- Why are we reading a paper about SSL, which apparently is deprecated, ins=
tead of reading a paper about its successor TLS?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">- What is an active attack (vs. a non-activ=
e attack)?

- Is =E2=80=9Cthe Horton Principle=E2=80=9D to say more, or less, of what w=
as actually sent? In other words, is it to provide context, or to remove it=
?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">1. Do modern servers still accept SSL 2.0 c=
onnections?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">6.858 - SSL

What issues did TLS solve over SSL? Are there still issues in TLS?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">According to https://tools.ietf.org/html/rf=
c7568, SSL 3.0 should be deprecated and replaced by TLS 1.2.
What exactly changed between SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.2 to cause this to happen? D=
id TLS just implement some of the suggested changes from the reading, or ar=
e there issues the reading either didn't address or addressed incorrectly t=
hat TLS fixed?

In a compact, haiku form:
IEFT says,
"TLS, not SSL."
Why is this safer?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Accordung to some sources, OpenSSL seems to=
 have around 500k lines of code. Is it possible (or viable) to implement su=
ch a system in a significantly smaller number of lines of code? Although it=
 is a system, it doesn't seem to require so many lines of code.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Apparently the IETF has prohibited the use =
of SSL protocol (according to Wikipedia page for TLS). Why and what else is=
 done instead?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Are Trust On First Use (TOFU) techniques re=
liable extensions to TLS? For example, Public Key Pinning (PKP) and HTTP St=
rict Transport Security (HSTS) are gaining traction, but is it really worth=
 it since a human must validate every initial interaction between client an=
d server?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Are a lot of internet vulnerabilities built=
 upon existing tools? (As in, because it was designed in some fashion in th=
e past, it's hard to instantaneously switch to a more secure and upgraded s=
ystem because you don't want to break what currently exists?)=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Are there any measures companies take to pr=
otect against mistakes in secure channels? For example, if a vulnerability =
were found in today's SSL, is there anything companies can do other than sh=
utting down their websites until a nonvulnerable channel were found and imp=
lemented?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Are there more protocols or attempts/moves =
to fix the issues with SSL 3.0?
Do people still use SSL 2.0 today? </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">As I understand, TLS is now the preferred p=
rotocol over SSL.  What are some of the vulnerabilities in SSL that TSL add=
ressed?  Why was a new protocol developed, rather than a new version of SSL=
 released?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Can you please briefly speak on POODLE and =
the most recent ROBOT https://robotattack.org/?

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Currently, what proportion of browsers impl=
ement the SSL despite it being deprecated? Have these resulted in significa=
nt attacks in recent years? Are other protocols built to accept SSL connect=
ions in general still?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Danny Tang

Lecture 15

SSL 3.0 is compatible with SSL 2.0. How are other protocols in terms of the=
ir compatibilities with each other? Is this a
priority in design?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Did Netscape's incorrect implementation of =
SSL 3.0 lead to any issues (with the change spec attack)?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Did the IETF Transport Layer Security make =
any changes in the spec for SSL 3.0 as a result of this document? Or was th=
e result mostly implementation-level changes?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Diffie-hellman key exchange is really cleve=
r and cool and secure, but it was invented in 1976.  Why did SSL2 not use D=
H key exchange?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Do all sites use SSL? Who implements it?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Do modern SSL implementations prevent these=
 kinds of attacks?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Does the authenticated but unencrypted mode=
 of SSL 3.0 still exist in modern
versions of TLS?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Export-weakened cryptography comes up numer=
ous times in the paper. Assuming I'm interpreting it correctly to mean cryp=
tography that complies to U.S. export law, why is it that security is weake=
ned. Is there an upper-limit to how export-controlled data can be encrypted=
? In other words why is it not export-strengthened? Or is it just that only=
 cryptographic methods verified as strong enough are allowed for use, so mo=
re modern algorithms cannot be immediately used?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">GitHub recently removed support for old cry=
ptographic standards when connecting to github.com (https://githubengineeri=
ng.com/crypto-removal-notice/). Although they gave a year's notice about th=
is change, it still resulted in a signficant amount of breakage, presumably=
 because many users were relying on old protocols somewhere in their stack =
without realizing it. Is there a reason that cryptographic protocols such a=
s SSL/TLS are generally implemented in userland (resulting in many differen=
t implementations/bundled OpenSSL versions for different apps that would al=
l need to be upgraded), rather than being implemented in the kernel like TC=
P is (where it would only be necessary to update the kernel)?=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Have SSL3.0 servers stopped accepting SSL2.=
0 requests now?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Have there been any very significant securi=
ty flaws in SSL 3.0 since this paper has been written?=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How does TLS compare to SSLv3 in terms of f=
ixing these potential vulnerabilities?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How does TLS supercede SSL and fix vulnerab=
ilities?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How exactly does the US government designat=
e which encryption algorithms are fit for exportation? Is it possible for a=
 non-US entity to simply increase
the number of bbits of complexity used in an algorithm to get around this?<=
/pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How hard is it to introduce the random padd=
ing to all cryptographic schemes? Is it just impossible to be exhaustive?

How much work is stripping off the authentication layer from finished messa=
ges as a man in the middle trying to convince two endpoints to communicate =
with no ciphertext?

What does a level of security mean? Just computation cost of brute forcing?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How has SSL changed in view of the demise o=
f "export-weakened" cryptographic protocols?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How has SSL changes since this publication?=
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How is a secure channel established in the =
first place? That is, how do the sender and receiver agree on some way to e=
stablish a cryptographic connection over an observable network assuming no =
prior information exchanged between the sender and receiver?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How is the pre_master_secret generated?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How many vulnerabilities does one have to f=
ind before replacing the current version of SSL/TLS?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How widely used is SSL now of days when we =
have newer standards such as TSL?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I didn't understand the informal analysis u=
sing the horton principle. How does the horton principle apply to cryptogra=
phy?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I don't really understand short-block attac=
ks. The paper states that:

Knowledge of the corresponding plaintext
for a correctly guessed replacement ciphertext block
enables the enemy to recover the unknown plaintext
byte.

why is this? Is this because there's a one to one mapping between trailing =
plaintext bytes and encrpyted bytes?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I don't think I fully understand the idea b=
ehind the Horton principle. Is it just the idea that you should encrypt mor=
e than just the content you are sending? Additionally, during the key excha=
nge is there anything preventing a man in the middle attack where a man in =
the middle establishes a session with the client an d the server seperately=
 and simply echos messages from the client to the server and back?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I found the use of the terms 'domestic' and=
 'export-weakened' crypto odd in the paper. What's the context for this?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I have to admit that while reading thi pape=
r, I realized that my understanding of SSL was lacking. Are there any parti=
cular resources that the staff recommends for me to catch up on SSl/TLS ?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I noticed this paper was written in 1996. I=
s SSL still in use and if so, how much has it changed since this paper was =
written?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I see that SSL 2.0 and 3.0 have both been d=
eprecated/prohibited from use, and that they were replaced with TLS. What's=
 different about TLS that makes it better than SSL? And why did it take so =
long to kill off SSL 2.0?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I was going to ask if SSL3 is still used at=
 all or if all connections now use
TLS. But, I was able to Google myself and find that SSL 3.0 was also later
prohibited in June 2015.=20

Has TLS also been a series of ad-hoc patches and bugs popping up? Or was TL=
S
better designed and is aging better than SSL?=20


</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I would like to see more of the attacks exp=
lained in depth during lecture.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I'm having trouble differentiating between =
TLS and SSL besides the fact that TLS seems to supersede SSL.  Is there a r=
eason we're focusing on SSL here instead?  Or is it just more interesting o=
f a vessel for the conversation we're going to be having?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">If SSL 3.0 first implements diffie hellman =
for key exchange, what did
earlier versions, such as SSL 2.0 use for that purpose?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">If someone intercepts the initial SSL messa=
ges then isn't the protocol useless. Because an underlying setting of param=
s is required to create the secure connection right? So is the upgrade even=
 safe?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">In a short-block attack, how does the attac=
ker have access to plaintext/ciphertext pairs?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">In dropping the change cipher spec message =
attack, how do an attacker make sure that [change cipher spec] does not go =
directly from Client to Server? Does this kind of attack require a compromi=
sed router?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">In the change cipher spec scheme, what exac=
tly does {a}_k represent? It seems that the attacker
has full access to `a` and can somehow decript it. Moreover, it is not comp=
letely clear to me how=20
a MITM can get teh chiper spec and still not be able to decode messages bei=
ng passed;
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">In the diagrams that explain the attack flo=
ws, it is clear to me that C and S=20
represent the client and server respectively, but it was unclear what M mea=
nt.=20
It is also unclear what the text following the flow means. I also noticed t=
hat
this paper assumes knowledge of SSL, which I don't have, so this lack of=20
background might be why these diagrams aren't familiar to me.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">In the version rollback attacks, I'm confus=
ed how the attacker can create a resume session on a lower level of securit=
y without having to renegotiate session. Where does the weaker key that the=
 attacker brute-forces come from?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is SSL still being used commonly? I read so=
mewhere that TLS is the new version of SSL and more commonly used, but if s=
o, did it make sense to update SSL to 3.0 rather than to switch to TLS? I=
=E2=80=99m assuming the update to SSL 3.0 was relatively recent since the p=
aper was from 2013.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is SSL still in use? According to wikipedia=
, it has been replaced by TLS. I happened upon this article (https://pulsej=
et.github.io/blog/posts/https-with-github-pages-custom-domain/) which seems=
 to be implying support of SSL. So, is SSL still in use?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is SSl 3.0 also be replaced soon with a new=
er version?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is TLS much more complex to study than SSL?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is everyone ready and able to adapt to SSL =
3.0, or is it what we use now?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is there a general way of designing protoco=
ls so that when the protocol is
updated, the new protocol is safe against version rollback attacks? Paul
Kocher's strategy seems to rely on the particulars of RSA encryption.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">It seems like the need for backwards compat=
ibility causes a lot of big problems - how do you get the community to quic=
kly update to the new standard?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">It's pretty surprising to me that a secure =
connection protocol is completely fine with not seeing the basic constructi=
on that makes the protocol CCA secure. What good is having support for a ma=
liciously secure cryptographic protocol if an active adversary can just cha=
nge the 'mode' to remove the message authentication? Why would the designer=
s allow this to be possible?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Lecture 15 (Question About Paper)

On page 6 the paper talks about { }k representing the keyed cryptographic t=
ransforms useed by the record layer. What do they mean by keyed cryptograph=
ic transforms? Is the transform of a message the same as the encryption of =
message? If this is correct, how did the two parties negotiate the key used=
 for this transform? { }k was introduced in the context of sending change c=
ipher spec messages, but when this happens, aren't the two parties still ne=
gotiating the encryption key?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Lecture 15: My SSL 3.0 Question

The authors mention that their SSL protocol has vulnerabilities that are on=
ly a threat for
active attacks. What exactly is an active attack? How is it different than =
any other type
of possible attack.

Thank you!

SSL 3.0 has since become deprecated, but how often do these cryptographic p=
rotocols change, and how much effort/overhead does it require to rehaul the=
 connections of the internet as bugs are discovered.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Looking at modern day TLS, it seems like SS=
L is no longer considered secure enough for use. If that is the case, why d=
oes the term SSL still seem to be synonymous with secure connection?</pre><=
/li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Question about Paper

1. They mention that 3.0 uses HMAC, but I remember reading that HMAC is not=
 100% verifiably secure. Is this is a current issue being discussed in SSL'=
s design or is it assumed HMAC is a secure MAC scheme?

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Question: Does SSL 3.0 still accept SSL 2.0=
 connections? Is there a newer version of SSL than 3.0?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Question: In the description of dropping th=
e change cipher spec message, the paper states that the attacker can interc=
ept the short encryption key and do an online attack against this key. I'm =
a bit confused about where this happens in the flow. What is the time windo=
w that they would have to perform this online attack in?

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The paper notes a number of issues surround=
ing active attacks that could compromise SSL 3.0. Were these the major poin=
ts of concern when replacing SSL with TLS as the standard, were new vulnera=
bilities discovered, or did SSL become less secure as compute power increas=
ed?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The paper notes that there can be many diff=
erent implementations of SSL that still satisfy the specification of SSL 3.=
0, some of which are safe
from the exploits noted in the paper. In addition, the backwards compatibil=
ity for SSL 2.0 adds even more different implementations of SSL that
have varying security properties. Is it inevitable when dealing with the In=
ternet and its various levels of technological progress that we have
many implementations of the same protocol? Won't the staggered progress alw=
ays leave exploits in their wake, especially as exploits are found
for antiquated techniques?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The paper often references export-weakened =
security and domestic-grade
security. How much is that still a thing? Have the US-export laws that
treat encryption as ammunition been amended?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The =E2=80=9Ccipher spec=E2=80=9D attack in=
 4.3 assumes the ciphersuite doesn=E2=80=99t include encryption.  But I tho=
ught the SSL protocol encrypts all data and messages?  What is and isn=E2=
=80=99t guaranteed to be strongly encrypted? </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">This paper asserts that SSL 3.0 was a signi=
ficant improvement over SSL 2.0. A quick search online indicates that SSL 3=

bilities? </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">This paper talks about making improvments t=

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Were changes made to SSL 3.0 after the pape=

For example, the paper says "The SSL record layer depends on a lot of conte=
