<h1> 6.858: Questions for lecture 16 </h1>

<ul>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How many of the things in section 5C have b=
een implemented and are in use in the "real world"?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">"HTTPS connec- tions to Facebook over multi=
ple ISPs within Syria were MITMed
with a Facebook certificate issued by the Syrian Telecom Ministry."

How did the Syrian Telecom Ministry manage to issue a Facebook certificate?
Also, since the Syrian Telecoom Ministry is not a browser-acceptable CA, ho=
w
did it get any browsers to trust it and accept the bad certificate (and hen=
ce
do MITM)?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">(pg. 515 in paper) - The paper says that th=
e browser OperaMini openly proxies HTTPs connections for the purpose of com=
pression between client and proxy. Didn't the paper also say that compressi=
ng HTTP traffic over TLS is insecure. Why is this different?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">- What is an oracle attack?

- What are EV and DV certificates? Extended Validation vs. Domain Validated=
? Is one better than the other (the paper mentions downgrading to DV)?</pre=
></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">1. Section IIIC describes an oracle attack =
in which an adversary can figure out a pre-master secret by repeatedly send=
ing separate handshakes with adaptively modified versions of the encrypted =
pre-master secret. This takes about 1M queries. Couldn't the server figure =
out what is going on and stop the attack?
2. How do certificate requesters demonstrate control over domains to CAs?
3. The paper describes security issues related to maintenance of Trust. The=
 authors say that even if a fraudulent certificate is revoked, it might tak=
e multiple days for this information to be available to clients, even with =
OCSP, due to caching. Where exactly are these certificates cached? For secu=
rity-critical requests, is there a way reject cached certificates and get t=
he certificate from the CA itself? Or is this not allowed due to DDOS conce=
rns?


</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">1. What primitives in the paper become inef=
fective if we assume that the adversary has access to the client's cache? <=
/pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">6.858 - SSL + HTTPS

Is DNSSEC fully deployed in the modern age? If so, what is preventing
DNS servers from using it?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">&gt; NIST strongly recommends that primitiv=
es hold the equivalent of 112 bits (symmetric) security strength and will r=
equire this by 2014 [22] (e.g., phasing out 1024-bit RSA/DSA and 193-bit EC=
DSA).
 * Why is having a protocol with more bits (e.g. 1024-bit RSA) not as good =
as having one with 112 bits of symmetric security strength? Is 1024-bit RSA=
 1024 bits of asymmetric security? If so, why are so many fewer bits of sym=
metric security preferred?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">According to the paper, CAs can issue certi=
ficates empowering other organizations to also be CAs.
It seems like this just introduces more problems, since now there are more =
CAs that could be vulnerable, and now browsers may have to validate chains =
of certificates leading to a trust anchor.
What purpose does this serve? Improved performance, since there can be more=
 CAs to issue certificates?
Bootstrapping new CAs as trusted via existing CAs? But then in this case, w=
hy would Ford, Marks and Spencer, and the US Dept. of Homeland Security be =
trusted as CAs, as mentioned in the paper?

In a compact, haiku form:
New problems arise
when CAs make new CAs.
Why do this at all?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Are all the security issues discussed still=
 problems? For example, parsing attacks seem realtively easy to solve since=
 there seems to only be a finite number of parsing problems you could have.=
=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Are blockchain technology be actively looke=
d into for using to help increase DNS or CA servers security?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Are there any notable differences in securi=
ty implementation between mobile and web platforms?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">CA seem to create bottleneck since they are=
 the sourse of certificates. Are there not protocols that confirm the authe=
nticity of a server by asking other machines on the network? Like crownsouc=
ing or block-chain, is there a means of verifing a machine based on a netwo=
rk of clients machines verying they have the same certificate identifier?</=
pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Can websites (aka server) implement additio=
nal security features on top of HTTPS/TLS to further decrease possibility o=
f MITM or other attacks?=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Can you elaborate on why MD5 is so bad? I g=
uess I just don't really understand what a "meaningful" collision is and wh=
y that's so relevant.=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Can you explain the distinction b/w TLS and=
 EV TLS?  At one point, the paper explained the concept of extended validat=
ion (EV), and later it discusses the use of three delivery mechanisms (no T=
LS, TLS, and EV TLS) for handling mixed content.  What is the difference b/=
w TLS and EV TLS, and when would you choose one vs. the other?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Considering that there are many different e=
xperimental systems out for certificate verification, would it be practical=
 for a state-level actor to obtain
a trusted CA certificate and apply it broadly (i.e on all traffic travellin=
g on an ISP) without some client likely detecting the MITM attack? Or would
such techniques need to be applied narrowly to avoid detection?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">DANE-based key pinning relies on the chain =
of trust for DNSSEC, which
ultimately relies on DNS zone operators to be competent and
well-behaved.  Why do we trust them more than CAs?  If it's because
there's only a single operator for each zone, rather than a variety of
operators with varying levels of competence, why is this better than
shrinking the set of trusted CAs?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">DNSSEC is essential to DNS based key pinnin=
g. Given this allows the creation of a secure record tied to a DNS name, wh=
at other security applications does it have?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Danny Tang

Lecture 16

How did the authors of this paper find all of these attacks? Is this a comp=
ilation of issues presented in other works, or did they
discover these themselves through testing?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Did TACK ever take off, and if it didn't, w=
hy didn't it? It says the TACK paper was published in 2012, which should be=
 ample time to be adopted.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Do SSL/HTTPS work any differently on mobile=
 browsers compared to the browsers on my computer?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Do certificate authorities have a jurisdict=
ion of sites to manage? How is the namespace segmented in general if there =
are multiple CAs that you can talk to? Is it fairly likely that multiple CA=
s will have keys for a given common name?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Do you think that widespread DANE deploymen=
t is realistic? What about ongoing
long term effort to deprecate normal unencrypted HTTP (first with HSTS, and
eventually by issuing security warnings for all http sites)?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Does key pinning through DNS assume that we=
 implicitly put some of the trust in validating certificates through DNS se=
rvers over CA servers? It seems that DNS attacks are more common than CA at=
tacks, so this might make the validation process more vulnerable.=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Each time a certificate for the same origin=
 is signed by the certificate authority, is it signed with a different key?=
 </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">From what I can tell it seems like CAs are =
still pretty widely used. Are there any key reasons why something like DANE=
 isn't as popular?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Given that there are so many security risks=
 involving HTTPS, how feasible would it be to design and implement an entir=
ely new system to replace HTTPS?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Has the problem of certificate expiration b=
een resolved? For example, if I was facebook and bought face.com, can I be =
assured that no valid certificates exist for face.com that aren't mine, or =
do I need to wait two years until they've all expired to be sure everything=
 is ok?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Have any of these described vulnerabilities=
 been addressed since the paper was written in 2013?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How big/prevalent of a problem is TLS strip=
ping in the wild?  The paper says =E2=80=9CThe chief mechanism for preventi=
ng TLS stripping is to make certain domains only support TLS and communicat=
e this to clients with a pin.=E2=80=9D Is this effective in practice? </pre=
></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How common is it for new CAs to come into e=
xistence and how easy is it to start one?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How do open CAs like Let's Encrypt affect t=
he trustworthiness of certificates?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How do the human factors surrounding DNS wo=
rk, particularly the root name servers? I can look up who runs them, but ho=
w is their behavior decided? What has to happen to create a new domain and =
propagate it across the servers?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How does a security designer decide what fo=
rm or forms of key pinning to use?
(client history vs server vs key pinning vs DNS)

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How does my browser (or is it the OS?) know=
 the root of the DNSSEC chain of trust? Does it have hardcoded DNSSEC root =
public keys somewhere, similarly to root CA certificates?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How does something become a trusted CA?=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How would an attacker compromise a CA to gi=
ve false certificates?=20
Is there a reason you would want to use all types of Key Pinning in unison?=
 </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I find it interesting that the previous pap=
er took the position that we can use
DNS through TLS to get secure DNS without DNSSEC, but this paper suggests u=
sing=20
DNSSEC as a way to further secure TLS.=20

In this paper, as with others we have read in the past, DNSSEC would seem t=
o
just solve the problem. So why hasn't more work been done to see it impleme=
nted?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I found it interesting when the reading men=
tioned how the understandability of security warning messages did not affec=
t the chance of users ignoring them. This seems to be a dangerous situation=
 since more and more users without security knowledges are gaining access t=
o technology. What do you think is the best solution for the security commu=
nity moving forward e.g. trying to educate users or hiding security decisio=
ns all together from users?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I think I am confused on the architecture o=
f CA, certificates, browsers, clients, and servers and how they relate and =
talk to eachother.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I think the MITM attack referred in this pa=
per focus specifically on the certificate authentication. Is it possible fo=
r the attacker to wait after the authentication finishes and then take over=
 the communication channel? Or maybe everyone message sent between server a=
nd client is encrypted such that adversary can not do that?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I've been wondering this for a while, but i=
f the HTTPS protocol is so effective, why is it not more widely adopted?

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">III-B-1) mentioned poor PRG seeding in embe=
dded devices specifically. Is there
an inherent reason why embedded devices might be more prone to poor PRG see=
ding?=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">If DNSSEC is the thing that makes Key Pinni=
ng (DNS) work, then if a client only uses DNS, this invalidates the Key Pin=
ning protection? </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">If a CA is somehow compromised, do browser =
manufacturers have a quick way to
revoke it from the list of trusted CAs built-in to the browser?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">In this paper, DNSSEC is seemingly used as =
a black-box solution that allows DANE to work. Although I am aware there is=
 controversy surrounding whether or not DNSSEC should be adopted, is it as =
secure as the paper assumes and has it been adopted enough yet to the point=
 where the use of DANE is viable?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is DNSSEC commonly deployed and used nowada=
ys?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is crowd-sourcing actually a viable option?=
 It seems like a neat idea, but could be subject to issues such as an adver=
sary spoofing a large number of 'peers' to provide faulty data.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is having increasingly more CAs a bad thing=
?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is it possible to perform a MITM attack on =
the DNS level? Not only to avoid DNS Key Pinning, but also, possibly, redir=
ecting the domain name to a different IP address?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is there any way to remove valid certificat=
es for previous owners of a domain name? The paper mentions that the previo=
us owner of fb.com could still have a valid certificate for it from when th=
ey owned the domain and it would still work today even though the site is n=
ow owned by Facebook. Is there any way to get rid of this potential certifi=
cate or render it invalid?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is there any work trying to deal with the b=
ack-compat issues that are at the root of things such as rollback attacks? =
 Or has that been decided to be sort of a fundamental problem in the space?=
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">It seems like CAs are quite a large securit=
y vulnerability. Is it possible to
design an internet system without CAs? Have you seen any papers that propos=
e
systems other than CAs for key management?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Key pinning based on DNS seems like a good =
idea, but DNSSEC does not seem to be widely used. What are the current solu=
tions to improving security of CAs?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Large number of trusted CAs raises the risk=
 of compromise. Why should CAs be able to issue certificates empowering oth=
er organizations to act as a CA? What are the privileges of those subCAs?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Lecture 16 (Question About Paper)

It seems like one of the biggest problem with HTTPS is the issuance of cert=
ificates. Have researchers explored implementing a proof of work system (si=
milar to bitcoin) to ensure that certificates are valid?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Lecture 16: Certificates
4/18/18

I don't quite understand the section where they talk about Transitivity of =
Trust. I says that there is in theory a chain of trust, but it says in prac=
tice not all of the chain is verified, and browsers instead rely on anchors=
?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Lecture 16: My SSL and HTTPS Question

How exactly does collision resistance deteriorate? For example, the paper m=
entions that
the MD5 hash function's resistance deteriorated over time from attacks, but=
 what exactly
does that mean and how exactly does it happen?

Thank you!
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Many people view the internet as decentrali=
zed, but if our security assumptions rely on trusted CAs is it really decen=
tralized?=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Question about Paper:

Which level would be best to pin the public key for HPKP? Pinning it at the=
 root be a bad idea, but is pinning it at the issued server certificate sec=
ure enough? Are there revocation extensions in OCSP/CRL to revoke old publi=
c keys that had their private key compromised?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Question: Is it possible for blockchain tec=
hnology to replace the need for certificate authorities?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Quinn Magendanz

Lecture 16

What does it take to become a recognized CA? Could an attacker create a CA =
to create valid certificates for itself?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Since a lot of the keys are generated by th=
e client instead of the server, and different clients have different RNGs o=
f different security levels, do people do anything to account for this serv=
erside?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Slightly unrelated to the paper, but are th=
ere any protocols that allow a DNS server to authenticate a client (rather =
than the other way around)?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Table 1 lists key pinning through DNS as ac=
hieving better defense against detecting MITM attacks than key pinning base=
d on client history. Give an example of an MITM attack that can DNS key pin=
ning can detect but key-pinning based on history won't. (A description of D=
ANE is here.)

Key pinning through DNS offers a better means of defense in detecting MITM =
attacks based than key pinning based on client history. For example, a clie=
nt visits a website for the first time. If keys are pinned through DNS, the=
 client can verify the website certificate's authenticity. If keys are pinn=
ed through client history, the client can not verify the website certificat=
e's authenticity.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The article touched the sovereign key conce=
pt. Self-sovereign identity is a hot topic, but can it be applied to domain=
 certificates? It might address various challenges with the trust to CAs.  =
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The paper asks a question that I still don'=
t understand after reading the paper -=20
"If a CA does no more than look at a DNS record to validate ownership, then=
 couldn't clients do it instead?"

If this is the case, then why do we have CAs still at all? What benefits do=
 CAs provide that necessitate their use? </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The paper briefly mentions at the end that =
replacing the CA infrastructure (or
at the very least, changing it significantly) may be a solution to many of =
these
issues moving forward. What has the direction of CAs been since this paper =
was
written?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The paper discusses further research and on=
going discussion, are these still important areas of open research in HTTPS=
 security and the certificate trust model?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The paper discusses proposals that involve =
different methods of key pinning, including CertLock, HPKP, TACK, and DANE.=
 What is the status of these proposals now? Are they still just proposals, =
have any been adopted widely?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The paper lists "Human Element and the Secu=
rity User Interface" as a persistant issue in security models. It also says=
 that "Testing defaults, UI changes, and the wording of warning dialogues r=
equires further research, as well as protocol =E2=80=98ceremony=E2=80=99 an=
alysis that includes humans."

It seems that blind trust by users and not wanting to read "things" is a hu=
ge problem (e.g. like with the Facebook user data policies now). What are t=
he sorts of research studies that the authors are mentioning? Is this actua=
lly an active area of research?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The paper mentions issues regarding confusi=
ng user interfaces and HTTPS. What are some examples of other security syst=
ems in which a poor user interface design affected the security of the syst=
em?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The paper mentions that Google Chrome curre=
ntly pins some certificates for its own domains -- do other browsers use ke=
y pinning? Are they
automatically supported or do they require extensions?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The paper states that intermediate CAs are =
effectively as trusted as trust anchors, and that the U.S. Department of Ho=
meland Security is one such anchor.  Does this mean that the DHS could tech=
nically launch MITM attacks over HTTPS for any site?

be any harder to transition to than any other widespread protocol switch. D=

DNSSEC have problems that make the transition not worthwhile, or is it that=
 our
current security methods are good enough that the slight additional securit=

what any of these terms meant, let alone whether or not I could tell if the=

 could be verified without needing to talk to the certificate authority. Th=

owners. Furthermore, the CA could build timestamps into the public keys tha=
t it issues, so the browser should only accept public keys with timestamps =
at or later than the latest timestamp it's seen. This was something that I =
wondered when I learned about DNSSec in 6.033 and all the headaches over ho=

How big of a problem is DNS name spoofing?  In a previous
