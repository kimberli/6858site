Taking the example of Pharmacy Express in the paper, the operators of the s=
pam value chain could take steps to hide the business chain of their spam. =
For example, they could register under a fake corporation for DNS and find =
a way to hide the bank account that the online payment would route to. This=
 would mean that the people studying their spam value chain would have much=
 less information about the spammers. In this paper, there is a pretty clea=

------------------------------

It's possible that an initial link could redirect to a CAPTCHA page, which
after completion then redirects to the ad. This would make it more costly
to crawl all the links received. As there for nearly a billion URLs crawled=
, a
CAPTCHA at each would seriously slow down crawling (although it also may hu=
rt
their sales as well).

Additionally, it seems that the botnet operators could use a TOR based botn=
et to
send emails anonymously from random TOR exit nodes. This would not hide the
click trajectories, as spam targets most likely don't use TOR, but it could
obfuscate more information about the perpetrator.

Lecture 18

Question:

How could the operators of the spam value chain, studied in this paper, mak=
e it more difficult to repeat such studies in the future?

Answer:

Randomize url redirects to make it harder to web crawl extensively, use eve=
n more ip addresses for the same domain to make it harder
to track, acquire more urls, hide links so that your webpage cant be crawle=
d and only the relevant buttons (ie. to purchase) can be
clicked.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">6.858 - Spam

The spam value chains can try any of these measures:
  - Locate and fill honeypots/other collection sources with garbage urls
  - Have servers that deny http gets to web crawlers/similar bots
  - Randomize page layout to make clustering harder
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">&gt; How could the operators of the spam va=
lue chain, studied in this paper, make it more difficult to repeat such stu=
dies in the future?

They are already using a very decentralised system to avoid scrutiny,
and they fact that the value chain has been so stratified makes it harder
to analyse.=20

One aspect that they mention is that the payment infrastructure used in the
value chain is very slowly changing in comparision to the E-Mail/DNS/Hostin=
g
side of things. So finding ways to become more flexible w.r.t to banking
providers would increase resilience in the spam value chain and make it=20
harder to analyse.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">A simple way to prevent a robot from crawli=
ng is to add captchas, as this would increase time/cost of performing this =
type of analysis.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">A spam value chain operator could diversify=
 the avenues through which they emit spam to make it harder to collect data=
. Email makes it really easy to collect data. Using other sources would mak=
e it harder to conduct a study. </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">A spamming website could impose captchas so=
 that they cannot be automatically scraped by bots, which this analysis rel=
ies on. </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Although significantly more difficult than =
using a botnet, a sufficiently powerful spammer could infiltrate and exploi=
t legitimate sites. This would then insert a legitimate source into the spa=
m value chain and therefore help the email from being regarded as spam in t=
he first place as the study gathered spam urls from anti-spam providers.
In addition a spam link could slow down the web-crawling portion of the stu=
dy by adding some mechanism to ensure an actual user is clicking through th=
e spam. Possibly by inserting some mechanism the user must interact with to=
 gain access to the actual content (i.e. clicking a legitimate looking "ent=
er site" button) and then reject any clicks that seem non-human.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Among the different methods possible, one w=
ay to make this kind of=20
study harder in the future is for affiliate programs to make dissimilar
templates for their users. Currently, users which use the same affiliate
program will end up with very similar websites in terms of realization,
so it's easy to deduce the influence of different affiliate programs and=20
to deduce information about them.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Answer to Paper Question:

They need to obfuscate name-records more. They could use the premium hosts =
discussed in the reading to furhter obfuscate their DNS information. Furthr=
more, they could add more "blacklist-poisoning" to hamper the researher's a=
bilities. Finally, they could obfuscate URL extraction in some manner to pr=
event a bot from easily collecting this data but still letting consumers ge=
t to the website. </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">As time goes by, there will be deeper level=
s of spam services as the operators sign contract to let spammers do their =
work. The center of the spam will also change.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Avoid sending spam to known spam researcher=
s. </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Consistently change the urls they use and m=
igrate their website to a new domain though this might be hard to do in pra=
ctice.=20

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Detect physical mail addresses ordering man=
y products in a short timeframe and block these orders
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">First, the operators of these websites coul=
d provide some kind of rate-limiting delay between traversing pages, slowin=
g down the web crawler.=20
The site can also attempt to identify the parser, and blacklist the associa=
ted IP address. Second, they could try and limit the ability to classify=20
these webpages by removing identifying key phrases or text, or even by usin=
g images instead which would then not be parsable. They could also attempt
to avoid displaying information that places their sites as part of a larger=
 program, thus making it more difficult to target the spammers specific
platform.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Firstly, they could add a lot of randomizat=
ion to the layout of their webpages. The authors were able to associate pag=
es as belonging to certain programs because of they attributes of the under=
lying page. Perhaps these server could instead serve pages with machine-opt=
imised code and certain amounts of variation to make such association harde=
r.

Secondly, they could try to split their payment systems. The use of a small=
 number of bank accounts and processors made it very easy for the authors t=
o track these programs, even when the sites appeared to be from two separat=
e affiliates. The spam operators should try to have their affiliate program=
s operate on completely different payment networks, or even incorporate oth=
er less regulated forms of payment, like cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies=
 like monero would also make it harder to track these payments on the autho=
rs' side.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">From my understanding, there are several wa=
ys the operators
can do:
1. Use diverse URLs or URLs that look official. Make URLs
collecting harder.
2. Use dynamic contents, which makes content clustering really
hard and impossible. Maybe have different contents for different
users.
3. Overall, the goal is to make everything hard to track and=20
not to display any certain pattern.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Given that they ignore IPv4 domains, perhap=
s hosting sites on IPv4 addresses is the way to go?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How could the operators of the spam value c=
hain studied in this paper, make it more difficult to repeat such studies i=
n the future?

The operators can have their own protections set in place that block an ip =
from cclicking their links if it has already clicked on a bunch of links (i=
e collecting 11m links that corresponded to 348 domains means that each dom=
ain had many links and their protection should prevent someone from clickin=
g on more than some threshold of links). They could also make their website=
s harder to crawl by obfusicating the website code.=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How could the operators of the spam value c=
hain, studied in this paper, make it
more difficult to repeat such studies in the future?

They could rent their services to spammers on a contract basis, and let the
spammers have more flexibly of switching between different domains so that
researchers cannot track their activities.

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How could the operators of the spam value c=

in the future?

Blacklisting can prevent successful crawling of the spam websites, although=
 it requires identification of the crawler. Operators of the spam web pages=
 could try to mess up the content clustering that the study did. I'm not su=
re whether/how this is possible, but they could possibly add a lot of hidde=
n HTML text so that the clustering tool can't accurately create the cluster=
 fingerprint.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How could the operators of the spam value c=
hain, studied in this paper, make it more difficult to repeat such studies =
in the future?

Key to their analysis is a collection of spam-advertised URLs, by setting u=
p their own honeypots or using commericial anti-spam providers.  This works=
, I would imagine, because email spam is indiscriminate, and it is feasible=
 to set up a honeypot that should get hit with a representative sample of a=
ll spam.

However, as operators of the affiliate marketing value chain move to platfo=
rms like Facebook, the spam (in the form of advertisements) becomes much mo=
re targeted, and it is also correspondingly more difficult to set up fake a=
ccounts as honeypots.  Thus, I would imagine a broad study of the value cha=
in is much harder in the era of Facebook ad targeting.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How could the operators of the spam value c=
hain, studied in this paper, make it more difficult to repeat such studies =
in the future?

Operators could have heuristics in place to notice fast flux suppression te=
chniques (in this case the authors "[queried] servers repeatedly to enumera=
te the set of domains collectively used for click support") and remove acce=
ss to people using them.  This shouldn't be actual user behavior and should=
 effectively.  Also, operators could just move to IPv6-only addressing whic=
h would make the namespace significantly more difficult to enumerate.  This=
 might make it tougher for every user to be be able to access the site thou=
gh.</pre></li>

They would do just the same thing anti-spammers do! Funny enough, they'd wa=

Unsure of how to interfere with the web crawling process, but I would imagi=
ne that continuing to do blacklist-poisoning at increasingly greater scale =
would make the process of filtering out the 'garbage' URLs more difficult a=
nd time-consuming.

For the content clustering and tagging stage, spammers could use images for=
 the frontend design instead of text that contains keywords in order to mak=
e it more difficult to classify html content automatically.</pre></li>

The technique involved relied on the traceability of bank records. Using an=
onymous transfers via cyptocurrencies and buying DNS records using untracea=
ble methods as well.=20

There're severar layers of protections, which the operations can apply:

1. Make it difficult/impossible to track down payments by accepting payment=
s in cryptocurrencies. Broadly speaking, it will hide the final recepients =
of the payments to.=20

2. Some possible protection from web crawling will prevent easy extraction =
of data from the websites as an attempt to recreate a holistic picture.

3. The authors mentioned that crawling all unique websites can be an unfeas=
ible exercise. Therefore, spam operators may want to create unique landing =
pages for each email they sent, though it can be an overkill taking into ac=
count the volume of the emails sent. Content delivery systems can be also o=
f a good help.

4. Tracking down the physical originators of shipping can be blocked by usi=
ng proxies - shipping handlers &amp; fulfillment processors.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How could the operators of the spam value c=

They could use machine learning to try to detect fraudulent clicks on their=
 links (ie clicks by researchers instead of by people who are actually inte=
rested customers) and direct them to alternate fake sites.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How could the operators of the spam value c=

One way that they could make it harder to repeat such studies in the future=
 would be to routinely/consistently change their page information such as n=
aming.  Further, they could provide false information about hosting or be m=
ore savvy with their URL redirection.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I have a few ideas, but I am not sure if th=
ey would actually make repeating such studies more difficult. Perhaps using=
 sites with embedded content make it more difficult to do DNS and Web crawl=
ing. Also, using images instead of text would make it more difficult to uti=
lize automatic approaches for extracting page content. Randomizing page con=
tent would also make these automatic clustering approaches more difficult.<=

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">In order to make it more difficult to repea=

Operators of spam value chains could make it more difficult to repeat such =
studies in the future
by taking steps to significantly limit crawling efforts on their sites. The=
y could do so by incorporating
the annoying "I'm not a robot" checks that a lot of websites include now to=

 trying to make purchases from some of these websites, and having them igno=
red because they thought the spammers recognized the high load of purchases=
 as fraudulent -- spammers could use pattern recognition to detect similar =

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Question: How could the operators of the sp=

paper, make it more difficult to repeat such studies in the future?

Answer:=20

Spammer can certainly use image-based websites instead of text-based websit=
es to
make automatic tagging and clustering much more difficult. Note that this
technique is mentioned in the paper -- however, not many websites currently
employ it, as mentioned in Footnote 6.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Question: How could the operators of the sp=
am value chain, studied in this paper, make it more difficult to repeat suc=
h studies in the future?

It seems like this study was already quite hard to do given all the work to=
 automate and yet they still had to manually tag/check things. One way they=
 could make it harder is to separate the domains more so it makes it harder=
 for researchers to cluster the same company together. Perhaps using more d=
istinc URLs could work too but it seems like they already do a good job of =
that. Also it says that they were able to cluster by similarities in hostin=
g and DOM elements so varying those would make it more difficult to repeat.=
 They mention how only a few programs that use a variety of resources so if=
 all sites spread out and used a little bit of every resource it would make=
 it harder. Granted, it would make hosting more costly. </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Quinn Magendanz

Lecture 18

How could the operators of the spam value chain, studied in this paper, mak=
e it more difficult to repeat such studies in the future?

The crawler exhaustively enumerates all A, NS, SOA, CNAME, MX, and TXT reco=
rds linked to a particular domain, so if the operators used a more diverse =
selection of records, they will go unsearched.=20

The operators could also spam for a more diverse market to make it more dif=
ficult to cluster the sites based on content.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Similar to how non-spam ISPs and email prov=
iders blacklist spam servers, spam servers could create a network that infe=
rs unreasonable use of spam sites by single IP addresses and blacklists the=
m. The url crawling was done with 100 firefox instances, likely on the same=
 network - so spammers could prevent researchers from learning more about t=
heir network by filtering out addresses that crawl many associated spam sit=
es, more than any single user would.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Since a lot of the data is obtained by craw=
ler, the operators can block access based on accessing frequency. In partic=
ular, the paper requires querying servers repeated to obtain the set of dom=
ains used for click support, which pattern the operator can observe and blo=
ck.=20
The operator can also make their website mostly purely image based, and wit=
h only very few texts --- this will confuse the content clustering process =
as it relies on text data. It might also be possible to flood documents wit=
h excess words(i.e. cat, dot etc that does not carry any negatigve categori=
zation), then make them invisible using CSS or even just hidden by javascri=
pt. So for an end user he/she won't see these words but the flood of such w=
ord will also confuse the categorizor.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Since the crawler ignores IPv4 addresses, a=
nalysis can be stopped by using IPv4 addresses instead.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Since the operators of the spam value chain=
 were disclosed in this paper, anti-spam services are likely to augment and=
 evolve their own resources to account for these operators. Therefore, in t=
he future, many of these same operators will not be applicable anymore.=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Since the study is based mostly on data acq=
uired by means of web crawlers, it would make sense for the people involved=
 with the spam value chain to make it harder for webcrawlers to function. T=
his may involve trying to filter out webcrawlers from accessing the page, o=
r maybe adding levels of complexity that would confuse the webcrawler.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Some actions the spam operators take to obs=
truct such studies are:
* Poison the URL blacklists with random domains.
* Diversify the DOM structures to avoid automated content clustering.
* Create multiple aliases for the same brand so it=E2=80=99s difficult to i=
dentify the affiliation unless purchases are made.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Spam value chain operators could continue t=
he process of creating more and more garbage domains to make it more diffic=
ult for the studies to farm useful results. Additionally, maybe it is someh=
ow possible for websites to prevent screenshotting of their content, or oth=
erwise mask it in some way, to prevent future studies from easily automatin=
g the process of grabbing the contents of the website the way this one did.=
 According to the papers, scammers also try to blacklist security companies=
 who are doing the crawling, so this is another option. Storefronts could a=
lso make their page entirely images so that the text is not scannable for c=
ategorization.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Spammers could avoid being detected in such=
 a study by improving their ability
to get around spam filters, which would avoid their URL getting picked up b=
y
the researcher's botfarm. They could also employ more complicated strategie=
s,
such as frequency switching domain name servers to confuse the DNS crawler.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Spammers could modify their webpages in way=
s that are visible to crawlers but invisible to end-users; for instance, ra=
ndomize the exact patterns of capitalization/indentation/spacing/tags in th=
e HTML to confound content clustering, include irrelevant keywords in small=
 fonts or non-displayed elements to confound category tagging.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Spammers could use short DNS records to mak=

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The "attack" that the authors of this paper=
 executed against the spam "system" can be outlined as:
1. Spam data collection (and analysis)
2. Crawling of naming/hosting infrastructure (and clustering/analysis)
3. "Following the money" when actually purchasing from these sites (and ana=
lysis)

To combat these "attacks," spammers can try a variety of tactics, but I wou=
ld anticipate the persistence of the researchers to quickly overcome the si=
mple changes that could beat some of the research processes.

First, the researchers already enumerate small annoyances such as redirects=
 (HTML, javascript, and even Flash) and outline fairly complete nameserver =
connections with their crawler. Simple changes like new kinds of redirects =
wouldn't have much effect (the researchers are using emulated firefox brows=
ers, which are fairly standard).

Another way to make it difficult would be to add more noise to the sites, s=
o the content clustering algorithm would have more difficulty grouping adve=
rtisements.

And finally, they could mess with the selective purchasing by adding a pseu=
do-fraud protection system in order to filter out purchases from researcher=
s (though this would be extremely difficult to implement in practice).
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The authors of the spam value chain paper w=
ill make it more difficult to perform these kinds of studies in the future,=
 because their paper being published will cause spammers to be more careful=
 about hiding their tracks and protecting themselves from researchers who t=
ry to study their value chains and undermine their monetization. Thus, the =
attackers will defend against the methods the researchers use and make it h=
arder to conduct similar studies in the future.

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The main source of data was the countless s=
pam messages/email etc. that they were previously able to acquire.=20
The authors then would get the URLs contained in these emails and have a we=
b crawler go through them in order
to characterize the websites, IPs etc. So here's an interesting idea: since=
 those links are themselves
already links to websites that will eventually transfer the user to the act=
ual website, one can have those intermediate
steps expire after a while that the spam was sent. So we would be virtually=
 cutting the connection between future researchers/users=20
that would try to access the website. Another idea, although harder to impl=
ement, would be to have the operators share information across
them. So that if any username with a peak of random (from pharmacy to cyber=
crime) activity would appear, they could simply not allow the=20

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The operators could change the domains of t=

ittle slowdown in the redirect process for individuals (perhaps one second =
per redirect), this would significantly slow down a machine running hundred=
s of browser instances since each redirect would require up to one second o=
f computation.</pre></li>
