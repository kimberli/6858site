<h1> 6.858: Questions for lecture 18 </h1>

<ul>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">
How is it that the crawler never got IP blocked/banned by the servers they =
were crawling?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How exactly do people determine the locatio=
n of a server? (Referencing the part where the authors mentioned how someth=
ing was in China, another thing in Brazil, and another thing in Turkey.)

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">"The crawler then performs recursive querie=
s on these domains. It identifies
the domains that resolve successfully and their authoritative domains, and
filters out unregistered domains and domains with unreachable name servers.=
"

Why did the crawler filter out unregistered domains?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">- The paper discusses several elements of t=
he spam value chain and illustrates it via a concrete example in Figure 1, =
but does not really define it. Is it just the process started by engaging w=
ith spam (e.g. clicking on a link)?

- How do we define spam and differentiate it from basic marketing/advertisi=
ng?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">1. I don't get the argument of intercepting=
 spam marketing at the economic level. Isn't spamming legal? How can you th=
en revoke their bank or payment priviliges?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">4/24/18

Lecture 18

It seems like the spammers making money is dependent on people actually buy=
ing the products that the spammers advertise. What
percentage of users actually click on the spam links, and what percentage o=
f those users actually buy the product?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">6.858 - Spam

Off paper, but curious - what research is there done for phising/fake websi=
tes
and advertisements?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">A few large affiliate programs (e.g. RxPrm,=
 Mailn) seem to be responsible for most of the spam. Is it impractical to s=
hut these affiliate programs down in foreign countries?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">A very interesting brand-new research "The =
Business of the Dark Web" has been done recently by Cybersecurity at MIT Sl=
oan. The research investigates cybercrime business models and value chains,=
 as well as provides with explicit analysis of the economics of cybercrime.=
 The research can be a good candidate for including into the course next ye=
ar. https://ic3.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/Business_of_the_Dark_Web.pdf

  </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">After this paper came out, was there discus=
sion in regards to the ethics of the study?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Are the adversaries in this case the spamme=
rs, the anti spammers, or the researchers?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Being that these spam entities are very unr=
egulated, it seems easy for them to steal your credit card information or p=
otentially phish users and steal information like passwords on top of selli=
ng their product.  Is this a common practice by these spammers that also se=
ll products as discussed in the paper? I could imagine a sketchy site selli=
ng this data on the dark web or something of the sort.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Could the span links discussed in the paper=
 also be used for more nefarious
things like XSS attacks?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Deciding to buy a bunch of products for res=
earch is not common. How was this received by the community?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Do any operating systems have support to ch=
eck for suspicious network activity themselves? For example, if they notice=
 that network use suddenly spikes when the user is logged out, they could n=
otify the user that a spam virus is likely on the computer. While this may =
be harder to implement on a Windows system, on a unix system perhaps one co=
uld make a priviledge separated network monitor that cannot be compromised =
by a compromised OS.

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Do email service providers utilize informat=
ion from web crawlers such as the one described in this paper in order to d=
etect spam on top of (what I assume are) ML and heuristic methods?</pre></l=
i>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Do operators of the spam value chain make m=
oney by essentially stealing it from users who click on their links? Or are=
 they tricking the user into buying their product? I didn't quite understan=
d where they make their money from.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Due to varying legal structures internation=
ally spam seems ill-defined. Is there a concrete legal definition for it in=
 the US?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">For html clustering, is a fingerprint in th=
is case a set of features that can be compared/operated on or just a number=
?

How do you obtain a VPN for a certain area?=20

Why do DNS name providers allow people to register obvious "throw away" dom=
ains used as initial landings for the spam pages?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">For the authors, the bottleneck in their st=
udy is in the banks too, because they need to make purchases to know which =
bank it was. So, is the sample size big enough to make figure 5c meaningful=
?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">From an economic standpoint, is spam funded=
 by a company maliciously something that happens too. For example, generall=
y spam on a product make it seem less legitimate. So if a company like Amaz=
on sponsored "spam" on an up and coming competitor is that something the up=
 and comer cna protect against 1) in cases where it knows its Amazon 2) in =
cases where it simply knows someone is paying ot produce this spam.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Has anyone endeavoured to repeat such an ex=
tensive study into the spam chain? Has the spam chain been researched furth=
er / more recently? </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Has the prevalence of spam been reduced sin=
ce this paper was published? Given that the writers of this paper were able=
 to develop web crawling techniques to identify spam, have any new solution=
s to prevent spam come from this? </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Has there been much of any legal or financi=
al crackdown on spammers? This seems like a difficult law to pass, but it m=
ay decrease spam.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Has this project been (or can it be) realiz=
ed into any software for warning users of potential spams such as a browser=
 extension?=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Has this research been used to create bette=
r anti-spam software?

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Have any of the ideas from this paper (e.g.=
 a financial blacklist) been implemented in the real world? Why is spam sti=
ll a problem?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Have there been any cases where spammers ha=
ve tried to take the pirate bay approach, i.e boil down the essential infor=
mation to a very small format so
it could just be easily archived and spun back up on some obscure hosting c=
onfiguration? It seems like developing some kind of generic site that could
be easily scaled and linked to could make for a very impractical game of wh=
ack-a-mole.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Have there been any policy actions taken as=
 a result of this analysis (e.g. increased regulation in the payment tier)?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How can they tell that a spam feed comes fr=
om a certain bot?  E.g., how do they identify samples from the Grum bot?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How can this chain be shut down?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How did the crawlers manage to stay secure =
when the spam might have lead to possible malware?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How did they get all the URLs used in this =
study? They mentioned a botfarm environment -- how was this used to find UR=
Ls?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How do spammers source their email addresse=
s? Compromising sites, using public
lists from other compromised sites, user accounts of their own websites, bu=
ying
them from someone else who gets them in these ways, bruteforcing common ema=
il
address names...?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How does fast flux work exactly for DNS? I =
didn't understand that well in the paper.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How does gmail filter spams that I can hard=
ly recieve any
email like this? Does it because Google owns the 8.8.8.8
dns server?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How does redirection prevent an ISP or Doma=
in Registrar from identifying the final server? </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How does the crawler network handle javascr=
ipt? Or even when the website is dynamic website(clicks are driven by javas=
cript renderings)</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How effective are spam filters on modern em=
ail clients (e.g. gmail)? Anecdotally, I rarely see spam in my inbox since =
almost all of it is filtered, but I'm not sure whether spam filters have ha=
d a significant effect on the profitability of spam marketing in general.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How effective is the anti-spam measure hash=
cash? Is it still used?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How exactly did the feed collection aspect =
of this research work? I didn't
entirely understand that part. In particular, I'm not sure what they mean a=
bout
using a "Botfarm spam feed."=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How feasible would it be to set-up a browse=
r-plugin that prevents transactions to these high-risk banks.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How is GMail so effective at stopping spam?=
 Is it because google works hard to maintain a blacklist of spammers or are=
 they using some other techniques?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How is this sort of phishing/spamming a via=
ble business model/justify the upkeep of the spam websites? That is to say,=
 what is the target demographic here? I would hope most if not all users wo=
n't end up blindly entering credit card information for something they don'=
t need or want, just because a website requests it.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How much of a problem are spam emails now? =
I guess this probably varies depending on one's email service provider, but=
 I essentially never get any spam email, so I wonder if this is much of an =
issue for others (although perhaps my spam filter is rather aggressive as I=
 think some emails from mailing lists I'm on get sent there too, though I'v=
e never noticed missing anything that mattered).</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How to spam filters filter out spam so effe=
ctively? Is it based on keywords in the email?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I am not sure that I understand the point o=
f purchasing goods, considering they spent up to $277 on each individual me=
rchant. This seems like a large amount of money to spend to gain informatio=
n about the banks and vendors used in the transactions. They addressed the =
ethics a bit, but was this paper thoroughly questioned after it came out ab=
out this? Have other studies also concluded it was worth supporting the ven=
dors and spending that much money for the information, or has it been large=
ly deemed to be a bad call?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I barely get any spam advertisements in my =
inbox since they are usually filtered out. Do the email spam based advertis=
ements pose as much impact on economy as other types of advertisements like=
 click baits?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I wonder why pharma is so prevelant in spam=
? </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I'm always surprised by the continued preva=
lence of spam mail. Another issue that has been rising recently is the prev=
alence of spam phone calls. One particularly troubling and seemingly new as=
pect of this problem is a spam caller's ability to impersonate another phon=
e number. I have received calls from telemarketers, redialed the number, an=
d got a regular person on the other end pick up and have no knowledge that =
their phone number had been used to call me.=20

I think people are much more susceptible to spam phone calls than spam mail=
. What is the security model of the telephone system? What would it take fo=
r an adversary to spoof a phone number? Where could one learn more about th=
is?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">If the registrars (e.g. NauNet) that served=
 domains for many spam programs were issued takedown requests, would that h=
elp with the spam problem?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">In the URL extraction process, why are URLs=
 with IPv4 addresses ignored?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">In the example spam chain (Section II, B), =
the authors mention that for the particular Russian domain name, the name s=
ervice machine is in China, and the site is hosted in Brazil.
They also mention that payment service is through an IP in Turkey.
Is there a particular reason why spam chains do this, as I would imagine th=
at normal name resolution would rarely cross multiple international boundar=
ies?
I think it would be to cover their tracks, but I can't quite think of a con=
crete defense that the spam chain operators would be worried about.

In a compact, haiku form:
I see that spammers=20
think centralized isn't good,
but I don't see why.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is it possible to combat spam by taking leg=
al action against affiliates?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is spamming actually illegal in the US, giv=
en that people are voluntarily providing their credit card information in e=
xchange for a physical product that they will likely receive? Spamming almo=
st just seems like less tasteful advertising, although I guess the ethics o=
f advertising is also questionable. Is there any legislation in the US or a=
broad that regulates spammers?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">It appears that spam advertising continues =
today because it works. Why are people so susceptible to this type of adver=
tising?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">It is not clear to me how domain registrars=
 are still able to operate even after providing certification for
spam operators. The paper reported about 900 registrars, which seems to be =
pretty tackable given the size of=20
the situation. Would this be mostly due to politics? The paper provided an =
example of pharmaceutical spam
supply chain in which Russia, Brazil and China are involved - if it is the =
case that registrars are of national
interest overall (I believe all of those countries might have countless reg=
istrars anyway), then that would be an interesting constraint.
Otherwise, I don't think the paper fully justifies the lack of action torwa=
rds them.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">It's clear that these spammers use banks in=
 other countries but is it known where many of these spammers actually live=
/are from?</pre></li>

Have policymakers tried to stop spam by targetting the payment tier?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Lecture 18: My Spam Value Chain Question

How effective is crawling nowadays? I know that the internet is now riddled=
 with the "I'm not a robot"

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Lecture 18: Security Economics
4/25/18

The paper says to have credit card companies refuse transactions with spamm=
ers, but why would they do this? The spammers don't seem to be breaking any=
 laws (in the US there appears to be a CAN-SPAM act that protects them if t=
heir spam accurately advertises their services), and customers are in fact =
willingly buying this product. By refusing spammers, credit card companies =
risk decreasing their number of transactions and annoying their customers, =
especially if any merchant was incorrectly classified as a spammer. </pre><=
/li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Once the data collection and processing wor=
kflow has completed, what is the point of it? What
can it be used for? What is the point of selective purchasing?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Question about Paper:

Where are the main spam-value chain operators located (is there a study, if=
 it is even possible, done on this)? Furthemore, with gmail's spam filter, =
is the spam economy making any changes (i.e. moving away from email spam) t=
o generate profits?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Question: What part of the spam is actually=
 illegal? It seems like mostly it is just annoying, and to shut down any pa=
rt of the pipeline you'd need to give a good reason because it seems like b=
anks etc have some financial incentives to keep providing services to spamm=
ers.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Quinn Magendanz

Lecture 18

Is there any way for a bank to know that they are dealing with money from t=
he spam industry, and if they do, what's the incentive for the bank to not =
do business?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Since their script clicks on basically all =
links on spam sites, how did they not get a lot of viruses?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Since we can track down the organizations c=
omplicit with this spamming, what's stopping authorities from stopping the =
spamming? For example, contacting the banks to shut down those accounts, et=
c.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">So many questions this week!

1) How do you pressure an ISP to take down a service?
2) Is there anything inherently illegal about spamming?
3) Why do spammers need to use re-direction strategies? How can something b=
e blocked if you navigate their directly but not through redirection? Who d=
oes the blocking?
4) Why might card associations want to moderate the spam business?
5) What is botnet harvested spam?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Spam filters are quite accurate and easy to=
 develop (given enough examples of spam). Have spam providers adapted in an=
y significant ways? How hard does gmail have to work to stay on top of thin=
gs?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Spammers fulfill their orders so users don'=
t complain to credit card companies and spammers' services don't get blackl=
isted by card providers. What prevents spammers from fulfilling orders, but=
 with low quality items or placebo pills, for example?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The Abstract of the paper claims that the a=
nti-spam is a multi-billion dollar
industry, but this goes uncited. How does that industry work? Does this jus=
t
refer to people and businesses paying for good spam filters, or is there mo=
re
to it?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The authors state that they were able to cr=
awl nearly 15 million URLs and only were able to download correct web conte=
nt for over six million of them due to things such as "... unreachable doma=
ins, blacklisting, etc".  What is blacklisting in this context?  Spammers h=
ave caught them and are blacklisting their IPs?  Spammers' sites are blackl=
isted?  By whom?  </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The paper concludes that targeting the bank=
s supporting spam is the most
effective way to prevent it, and it seems fairly convincing to me. Given th=
at
this paper was written 7 years ago, however, have spammers found a way to
circumvent this weakness?

Also, would it make sense to pressure companies like VISA to prevent spam a=
lso?
It seems like they are often a critical part of the spam chain.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The paper discusses takedown requests in re=
lation to the spam network itself. However, does a similar process occur to=
wards the affiliates that utilize spam networks to advertise? Given that th=
e paper backtraces email spam to garner information on the spammer, I would=
 believe the same would be possible for the seller.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The paper mentions that "spam is ultimately=
 supported by Western money" - do other countries have stricter ways of con=
trolling spam? How?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The paper notes that the most effective met=
hod of limiting spam may be at the
Payments level, but this requires a policy change to have effect. Are there
other levels where a more practical intervention would be more effective th=
an
commonly deployed methods (spam filtering, etc.)?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The paper notes the questionable status of =
legality for the services that spam operators provide in non-Western countr=
ies.
Have security researchers in non-Western countries been in the discussion o=
ver the spam value chain? Do their views

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The spam filters seem to be way more advanc=
ed now. In my experience, I don't feel affected by spam (if I exclude promo=
tions from the stores I shop). Why is it still considered to be a problem?<=
/pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">They mention that possible policy actions w=
ould be western pressure on countries that allow such practices. Has it bee=

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">This paper provides a lot of information as=
 to the features of spam emails, their domain/url characteristic. I wonder =
if anyone has used this information to create a good spam filter. And if so=
, is the filter effective?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">This research paper is about eight years ol=
d. Given the exponential growth of internet users (and existence of probabl=

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Was any work done to disrupt the bottleneck=
 identified within the paper?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Was it really necessary for them to purchas=
e many of the products and actually analyze the products?  I could see wher=
e knowing the banking information would be useful, but I wasn't as sure abo=
ut actually analyzing products that were received.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Was there any action generated by this pape=

?

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">What are the legal issues concerning the sp=
ammers? Is spamming illegal? Or is it just the sale of illegal goods that i=
s illegal? In other words, are they trying to prevent spammers from sending=
 mass emails or are they trying to prevent spammers from selling illegal go=
ods on the black market over email?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">What distinguishes =E2=80=9Cspam=E2=80=9D f=
rom a non-spam online purchase?  The authors describe an online transaction=
 pipeline as an example of the spam value chain.  But if I were to see an a=
d for some product on Amazon, click on it and purchase the item, there woul=
d be a similarly global transaction taking place though I wouldn=E2=80=99t =

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">What is the purpose of the DNS crawler? I u=
nderstand that the web crawler collects the web page content of the url in =
question. The DNS crawler presumably collects all the IP addresses(or DNS r=
ecords) associated with a domain. Is this the data that is fed to the web c=
rawler?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">What strategies do DNS registrars implement=
 to determine if they should shut down a site for being spam?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">What's the impetus to shut-down these spam =
sites? They're clearly providing economic value.=20

Online gambling is also tracked and shut down online. Why doesn't the gover=

actly is online gambling shut down in the US? Do the banks enforce it?</pre=

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">What's the main takeaway of this paper?  Th=

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">When the paper authors refferred to botnet-=
harvested spam, do they mean examining data sent by computers they have kno=
wingly infected or something else?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Where does the line between legitimate adve=
rtising and spam get drawn? Does the data account for user-subscribed email=
s/promotions? How does one factor for that?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Why are some hosting sites able to offer "b=
ulletproof" hosting that is not vulnerable to takedown requests? What do th=

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Why do we want to intervene with businesses=
 done via spam? We already have spam filtering, so what is wrong with busin=
esses trying to get revenue via people who happen to choose to click on suc=
h advertisements?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Why does a site need to run its own nameser=

 straight to their webservers by existing DNS infrastructure?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Why does it seem like spammers are never pr=

Why is the majority of spam found in the study linked to
