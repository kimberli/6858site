<li><pre class=3D"student-text">A benefit is anonymity. A technical risk is=
 lack of security because anyone could use your machine to make connections=
 to malicious servers on the internet.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Some technical risks of running an onion ro=
uter Tor node on a machine include being vulnerable to DoS attacks, bringin=
g down the
usefulness of the machine and disrupting circuits containing the OR. Runnin=
g an OR also requires intimate knowledge of the Tor
network or else runs the risk of abuse and attacks being linked to the OR. =
Some benefits of running an onion router include
allowing a longer circuit to be made for OP to send data through, making it=
 harder for an attacker who can compromise ORs
from compromising whole circuits before the ORs discard the relevant inform=
ation.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">- risks:
  - You could go to jail if you're running an exit node and the traffic isn=
't legal--your IP is "responsible".
  - Your node could be subject to attacks (ex. DDOS).
- Benefits:
  - You can analyze traffic patterns and will have an encrypted version of =
potentially private data. This isn't really much of a positive, and if it i=
s, it's a bit of a creepy one.
  - You're contributing to keeping tor usable.
  - You technically could have an easier time spoofing MITM attacks. Unclea=
r if this is a positive, though.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">1. For personal security, running a OR on t=
he same machine as your own OP can help defend against timing attacks that =
look for correlations between client and server activity. An observer woudl=
dn't be able to differentiate between locally generated traffic and routing=
 traffic.

2. Running your own node, assuming you are trustworthy, increases N, the nu=
mber of OR nodes. Adding more nodes to the network reducing the amount of t=
raffic an attacker (controlling m nodes) can completely control through the=
ir own nodes.


</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">6.858 - Tor

Benefits:
  - Having a large number of routers mean that you can use them as rendevou=
s points?
  - You can use the router as a start point to mitigate end-to-end attacks

Risks:
  - Prone to DOS/TLS handshake attacks that eat up computation
  - Falsely accused of illegal activities that tor users might be doing
 =20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">A benefit of operating a Tor node is that i=
t helps to make the overall Tor network faster and more secure. The authors=
 also state that it may also offer the operator better anonymity. It does n=
ot always have identifiable benefits for the person running the node, howev=
er.

Risks of running a Tor node may include legal action by governments (seizur=
e of hardware) or blacklisting of the node's IP address by government or ot=
her non-Tor-friendly sites, particularly for exit node operators.</pre></li=
>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">A benefit of running an onion router on my =
own machine is for better anonymity, to make it harder for adversaries to a=
nalyze my traffic patterns. A risk is that if my node goes down, all the ci=
rcuits going through my node will also be broken. In addition, there may po=
ssibly be the risk of being associated with illegal criminal activity.</pre=
></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">A benefit of running the OR on your machine=
 is that it is easier to compromise if it is run remotely, which would comp=
romise all future connections through it. A risk is that an attacker compro=
mising an OR vs. just a client will have a lot more power.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Advantage:
Running a node would give volunteer with publicity and better anonymity.=20

Disadvantage:
There may be a source of abuse and there is a concern about running a node =
on the machine in affecting performance of your own machine for other tasks=
.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Advantages and disadvantages of running a t=
or node:=20

Advantages:=20
    Encryted traffic
    Hidden entry point to network
    Low bandwidth
Disadvantages
    some websites ban tor?=20

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">An attacker might be able to use timing att=
acks to infer the indentity of a user/client. Thus, if the client has its o=
wn onion router, it can possibily foil the attacker by routing packages som=
ewhat randomly to defense against such attacks. On the other hand, adding a=
nother router adds up the brittleness of the system(especially the circuit =
around that node), therefore one might need the custom router to be strong =
enough against possible attacks.
 </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Answer about Paper Question

The benefits are that it allows you to get around censorship, allows you to=
 to be anonymous to websites as well as hide IP address, and then also prov=
ides anonymity through obfuscating traffic. The risks are that it gives fal=
se-sense of security (leaked information), exit/entry nodes see the the pla=
intext traffic, and authorities can still monitor/track a users' ISP connec=
tions leading to other privacy losses. </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Attackers could implicate your OR in illega=
l activities. Your OR might also have to process many connections to the re=
quested destinations and relay data. Running an OR node on your machine pro=
vides the best anonymity because traffic coming from your own node could pl=
ausibly have come from elsewhere.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Benefit of running onion router is that you=
 promote anonimity (anonymous browsing experience). Technical risk is that =
it gives a lot of traffic.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Benefit: The user maintains TCL connections=
 to all other onion router. So if the user wants to use Tor himself, it wil=
l be faster. Also, the user doesn't have to worry about being deceived on t=
he router membership list. Most importantly, running your own OR is safer a=
gainst end-to-end traffic confirmation, because traffic coming from your no=
de could plausibly have come from elsewhere.

Risk:=20
1. A lot of information flow goes through your PC, costing a lot of bandwid=
th.=20
2. Tor's code might not be perfect, leaving you vulnerable to potential att=
acks.
3. Attackers might decide to DoS you.
4. The FBI might decide to arrest you.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Benefits
    - Improve security of the overall Tor system
    - Can have a private, anonymized web experience
    - Increase the performance of the Tor system

Risks
    - Experience significant traffic which can be used to deanonymize you
    - Drains battery life due to CPU=20
    - Likely to be a point of attack for deanonymizing other users
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Benefits include convenience. Being directl=
y on the Onion Network is helpful because it lowers latency for yourself, b=
ut it comes at the drawback that you might be attacked by DoS attacks or ot=
her maliciousness.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Benefits of running a node:
 - Make the Tor network more robust to attackers (for example, the more nod=
es there are on the network, the more nodes an attacker needs to control in=
 order to correlate a significant fraction of traffic; the more nodes, the =
more resilient the network is to DoS)
 - Makes the Tor network more performant (greater total bandwidth)
 - Provides better privacy for users

Risks of running a node:
 - legal concerns: running an "exit relay" exposes the administer to legal =
risk depending on the content that is being passed through
 - exposure to attacks: for example, someone running a node is more likely =
to be targeted for a DoS attack.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Benefits of running an onion router Tor nod=
e include increased privacy in the sense that it is harder for communicatio=
n links to be tracked. Risks include being a targeted point of attack -- be=
 it through bandwidth overload in cases of dynamic conditions (accidential =
or intentional congestion) on the Tor network, denial-of-service attacks mo=
unted on a node by forcing it to continously perform expensive cryptographi=
c operations, and being susceptible to the brittleness of the network (if c=
onnected nodes to the Tor node go down, all streams are broken and the Tor =
node is left isolated as it has to rebuild its circuits/streams). Any Tor n=
ode is susceptible to attackers performing "antisocial" activites in attemp=
ts to bring down reliable nodes and undermining the reliability of the netw=
ork.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Benefits:
    it'll be hard for other people to tell what traffic is your stuff and w=
hat traffic is others' stuff.

Risks:
    you'll probably be a high(er)-priority target for various attacks.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Benefits:
- Traffic through me, could possibly get paid for it if its a BGP like setu=
p
- Don't have to do much routing or path construction like a normal router, =
just path extension, decrypt and follow path suggested by the packet itself=
 since the user has already created it
- Token bucketing on the tor servers end to prevent bandwidth hogging

Risks:
- Sources will know my existence, so can potentially overwhelm me or DoS me=
 and affect other traffic of mine
- Overhead of key exchange with individual sources and potentially storing =
all this information
- Onus is on you to be highly protective of keys etc. This is even higher i=
f you are a guard node.
- Need some support for congestion control in addition to traffic shaping
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Benefits:
	- You're a good person

Risks
	- could be a target of a DoS attack</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Benefits:
-circumvent censorship
-provides anonymity by routing traffic through three relay servers (somewha=
t like using three proxies)
-can be utilized to provide anonymity to websites (.onion TLD available onl=
y within Tor, and there is no exhaustive directory/search) which are only a=
ccessible by other Tor users (hidden services)
-hides your IP address

Risks:
-Authorities can monitor and track users' ISP connections even if they can=
=E2=80=99t find the real IP addresses hence:
-May provide a false sense of security to non-technical users, especially t=
hrough leakages such as DNS, applications not configured to use the local T=
or proxy port, etc
-Low latency anonymizers are prone to traffic analysis
-Exit nodes see traffic in plain (no encryption, unless encrypted at applic=
ation layer)</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Benefits:
Anonymity
Can transfer traffic, contributes to the network

Disadvantages:
Risk of abuse from other nodes
IP marked
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Benefits: Privacy --&gt; Hard to tell origi=
n of packets
Risks: DoS attacks, implication in illegal activity if packet involved in t=
he said activity routed through user=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Benefits: There will be a lot of traffic co=
ming out of your machine so it will be even more difficult to tell which tr=
affic is yours.
Risks: You don't control what traffic is coming through, so illegal traffic=
 may come through your network.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Benefits: You get to use TOR. If run an exi=
t node, you can sniff the traffic.=20

Not-Benefits: If you are an exit node, you bear more of the burden because =
you are connected to the outside world and not to another TOR node. Attacke=
r could trick your OR to run software that provide users with less anonymit=
y.A benefit of running an exit node would be that you can sniff the exit tr=
affic.


</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Benefits: allows you to send/receive traffi=
c anonymously, risks: possible legal liability
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Benefits: slightly stronger anonymity becau=
se traffic is never traveling alone out of your machine; it originates mixe=
d in with everyone else's. No risk of attacker controlling start and end no=
de since the start one is yours (hopefully).

Risks: Everyone else's packets are now passing through your machine and hav=
e the opportunity to attempt to exploit it. Having all of your traffic alwa=
ys originate from the same node may leak information.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">By running a TOR node, you increase the tot=
al capacity of the network.

One risk of running a Tor node is that your ISP may not be pleased, and you
could otherwise attract unwanted attention. Another risk is that if you are=
 also
using Tor, a sophisticated attack might be able to correlate the two source=
s of
traffic and compromise your privacy.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">By running a tor node, the user is connecti=
ng to the network not just from their own traffic, but also by connecting d=
ifferent circuits. This can help frustrate traffic analysis. However, this =
also means tha the user is more susceptible to DDOS attacks or being implic=
ated in the wrongdoings of others using the network. In essence, by connect=
ing yourself tighter to the network, it is harder to determine what actions=
 are yours, but also you take increased liability of the actions of the net=
work as a whole.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">By running an OR Tor node you sacrifice ban=
dwidth on your machine. The OR is
also run as a normal user-level process without special privileges, so if y=
ou
mistakenly downloaded a malicious fake version of the software you could ha=
ve
your private files read.

If you are an exit node you could be implicated in the legal actions of the
clients whose traffic you relay. If you are a location-hidden service, thou=
gh,
you do not even expose your IP address.

Overall Tor is designed to minimize exposure from running the service to
encourage adoption, which increases anonymity for everyone.

As far as gain, you gain more anonymity in your communications because it i=
s
less clear which cells originate from you and which you are merely relaying=
.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">By running your own OR, you run the risk of=
 somebody claiming that some illegal activity actually came from your machi=
ne, or of some service blocking your IP when malicious traffic comes throug=
h it - hopefully TOR helps mitigate this!
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">By running your own router you have more an=
onymity. However if the node
is used by someone else and is somehow tracked, your network could be
compromised.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Collaborated with Claire Nord

The technical benefits of running an onion router include increased anonymi=
ty
since there would be more traffic running through your access point.=20

The technical risks of running an onion router include being implicated in
potentially illicit activities occurring over the network (if you're an exi=
t
node), and use of bandwidth. =20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I belive that middle relays are in general =
safe from major risks, since they only have packets passing through them - =
they are not able to open those packets and so on. A bigger problem probabl=
y occurs in the exit relays, since now this IP is the one that is critical =
for communicating. This means that an "attacker" or "evil user" going throu=
gh this relay might do bad stuff that is then labeled with this exit relay.=
 So in the general the risk is legal and social. I couldn't find any specif=
ic reasons for why anyone would become a node if not though the general hac=
ker feeling and general mission that Tor embraces. An interesting blog post=
 wrote: "In the grand scheme of things, Tor is pretty benign. I fluctuate b=
etween 2-5 Mb/s depending upon how much transit I've consumed for that bill=
ing period. Tor's bandwidth controls are surprisingly accurate. When I conf=
igure Tor to consume 1.8TB of transit over 30 days, it'll do it and not a b=
yte more." although they did *not* mention why it was benign or how.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">It seems like the only "benefits" of runnin=
g a Tor node is that you contribute to the overall Tor project, and feel go=
od for doing so.

Technical risks include: High usage of your machine's bandwidth through ser=
ving other relay requests (or worse, DoS attacks), you probably will end up=
 on a government blacklist, you won't be able to watch Netflix.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">It's necessary to distinguish between runni=
ng a relay node and running an exit
node. Running a relay node helps strengthen the anonymity of the Tor networ=
k
overall, and it can be used as a guard and therefore protect user IPs.
Disadvantages include large banwidth usage, and the risk of getting blocked
from websites that dislike Tor.

Running an exit node is riskier. It's technically beneficial in that it fur=
ther
strengthens network security by increasing the number of Tor exits, and it
increases your own anonymity (i.e. protects you against end-to-end attacks)=
 in
that traffic coming from your node could plausibly have come from somewhere
else. However, it opens you up to loss of anonymity in another sense becaus=
e
all traffic from the exit can be traced to your IP address (and this can ca=
use
severe legal issues since you can't control what content is held in the tra=
ffic
coming through your node).
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Lecture 20 (Answer to Paper Question)

Question:

What are the technical risks and benefits of running an onion router Tor no=
de (i.e., not just a client) on your machine?


Risks: Many use Tor's anonymity guarantees to do something illegal. Because=
 of this, in the past, the NSA and FBI have specifically targeted Tor users=
. Although nobody has been sued or prosecuted for running Tor, it's somethi=
ng to keep in mind.

Benefits: Tor allows users to browse the web anonymously. This is especiall=
y useful in authoritarian states, where governments censor their citizens' =
access to the web.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Lecture 20: Anonymous Communication Nick Ma=
tthewson
5/2/18

What are the technical risks and benefits of running an onion router Tor no=
de (i.e., not just a client) on your machine?

- increased risk of getting attacked as by getting control of a machine tha=
t runs an OR they can observe traffic
- DNS attacks, though user specifies how much resources they're willing to =
give

+ increased anonymity because traffic from user node might not necessarily =
be user traffic (diverted from elsewhere)</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Lecture 20: Tor Reading Question

Risks

  This is more of a detriment than risk, but increased latency.
  On a related note, attackers could make matters worse by running a DoS at=
tack by initiating numerous fake handshakes across the system.
  There is also the worry of accidental or intentional congestion if enough=
 users choose the same OR to OR connection.
  There are more attacks possible, but I would not qualify them as risks, b=
ecause they do not put users at more risk than they would be without Tor.

Benefits

  Encrypted traffic, mostly preventing attackers from seeing exactly what u=
sers or doing, or making it hard to see at least.
  This also provides user anonymity, again preventing or at least making it=
 harder for attackers to know which user's traffic they are interacting wit=
h.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">One of the benefits of running an onion rou=
ter is increased anonymity. It becomes more difficult for an adversary to d=
etermine if traffic coming from your machine is generated by you or by othe=
rs on the Tor network. The risk is that you will have to give up some of yo=
ur bandwidth and memory in order relay cells in the Tor network. It now bec=
omes possible to be the victim of DoS attacks on the Tor network. Furthermo=
re, it is possible to be "framed" or smeared for bad behavior on the intern=
et - for example if someone on the Tor network conducts an attack or access=
es bad content through your router.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">One of the dangers is that you as the user =
will be associated with that onion node.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">One risk of running a Tor router on your ma=
chine is that you're allowing other people's traffic to use your network, w=
ithout knowing what the traffic is or if it is legal.=20
One benefit is that running a Tor router adds a router to the network, whic=
h helps the anonymity of the Tor community as a whole.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">One risk of running an onion router Tor nod=
e is that an ISP might notice that a node sends messages to potentially-ske=
tchy domains (on behalf of other clients), and incorrectly conclude that th=
e node administrator is malicious. A potential upside is that the node admi=
nistrator would be able to plausibly deny having sent any given traffic.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">One risk of running an onion router Tor nod=
e on your machine is that you could be the exit node, meaning that your IP =
would be recorded and you could be identified as someone passing illegal pa=
ckets of other Tor users. One benefit is that it could provide extra anonym=
ity because you can't tell if packets from your node are from other users o=
r from you.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Pros
- You are adding more nodes to hop through in the system. This will help in=
 sharing load/bandwidth and will reduce access time of requests sent over t=
he network.

Cons
- Running such a network requires work -- need to install a dedicated serve=
r, respond to copyright violation notices, risk having your AP being blocke=

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Question: What are the technical risks and =
benefits of running an onion router

Answer: Risk-wise, setting up your machine as a onion router node can open
yourself up to potential DDoS attacks. Benefit-wise, by running an addition=
al
onion router, you make the Tor network bigger, and therefore more resilient=
 from
hostile union router attacks as described in Section 7.

What are the technical risks and benefits of running an onion router Tor no=
de (i.e., not just a client) on your machine?

There are only 32 nodes on the TOR network at the time of this paper.=20

Some benefits of running an onion router node are:
-ORs can write to packet headers or rename itself to give warning to receiv=
ing servers that the packets have gone trough an anonymity network and thus=
 may be risky
-Your OR can see routing information on packets and filter hostile sources

Some risks of running an onion router node are:
-At risk of DoS attacks
-An attacker who learns your OR TLS private key can impersonate you
-You are at risk of iterated compromise where an adv. compromises ORs down =
the path. </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Risks of running an onion router:
* If someone uses my OR as an exit point to perform illegal activities, it =
looks like I'm performing the illegal activities and I might get into troub=
le for that. To prevent this, I could change my exit policy from "open" to =
"middleman" or "private", but then I'm less useful for the Tor network
* "Each onion router maintains a TLS [17] connection to every other onion r=
outer" -- this might result in (too?) many open TCP connections on my machi=
ne
* An attacker can fake the start of a TLS handshake, which requires me to m=
ake some expensive cryptographic calculations at no cost for the attacker, =
so an attacker could run a DoS attack against my CPU

Benefits of running an onion router:
* Feeling cool
* Helping users who want to or have to stay anonymous

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Risks:
- If running an exit node, you have to set exit policies to mitigate exit a=
buse.

Benefits:
- If running an exit node, you can sniff traffic that goes through the node=
.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Risks:
- Worst when running an open exit node, which makes all traffic coming out =
seem like it was sent by you (lots of spam, serving illegal content, etc.)
   - Could result in legal consequences
   - Could result in network bans / censorship (for spam or censored conten=
t)
- Takes up network bandwidth (although token-limited)
- Takes up computational resources
- If there are weaknesses in the node software, attackers could exploit the=
m (just like running any web server)

Benefits:
- Altruism: enabling others' anonymity (political dissidents, etc.)
- Can study traffic coming through network
- Can attack network if you get enough (ability as a benefit?) - government=
 nodes
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Risks:
1. DoS attack can be performed on Tor node.
2. Overhead to their machine if there are many connections
through it.
3. May leak some private information.

Benefits:
1. The machine running node may also use Tor service.=20
2. Volunteers running node are rewarded with publicity=20

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Running Tor as an Onion Router would provid=
e a theoretically ideal privacy - since many different packets from differe=
nt origins pass through the router, it would be hard for an adversary to te=
ll which packets were actually send from the router hoster.

On the other hand, hosting a router can provide multiple implications: 1) D=
oS attacks can significantly impact the hosting machine's performance. 2) I=
f the router is hosted as an exit node, and some illigeal activity is being=
 performed through the node, the hoster might be implicated.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Running a OR on your own machine helps cont=

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Running a Tor node on your machine puts you=
 in the lime light of attackers because it is easier for an
attacker to mask his trace in an anonymous network like Tor. Running a Tor =

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Running a Tor node will put you at risk of =
experiencing a denial of service attack. In reality, the reason most people=
 are hesitant to host nodes is that they are worried about dealing with abu=

e is. It seems like hosting is a service that people on their volition beca=
use they care about the cause. </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Running a Tor server allows you to help the=
 world gain anonymity on the Internet, including yourself. However, your co=
mputers will spend a lot of time doing encryption tasks which will just tak=

because of the amplification of a single request that it takes to forward i=

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Running an Onion router node on your networ=

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Running an exit node presents one as the so=
urce of all exiting traffic whether it be malicious or not. This means a cl=
ient running a node of this type can expose themselves as a criminal target=
 if investigation occurs into the source of network activity from the node.=
 Acting as an OR also exposes ones machine to DOS attacks, though there are=
 some mitigations built into TOR's design.
At the end of the paper, the author's mention that those who run ORs benefi=
t from publiticty from volunteering. Along with this they may also have gre=
ater secutiry as they do not have to interact with middlemen to use the TOR=
 network as they can communicate directly with other OR.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Running an onion router Tor node on a machi=
ne comes with the possibility that the node will be one of the central ones=
 that is bottleneck. Therefore, there is a chance that the node will be con=
gested by too much traffic. On the other hand, the node owner can monitor t=
he traffic and gather an important information about the network.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Running an onion router on your own machine=
 improves your anonymity, since it will be harder for an attacker who sees =
traffic to and from your machine to tell whether that traffic is yours or b=
eing forwarded for other people.
On the other hand, it adversely affects your performance, since your machin=
e has to do all the extra things a router supports to forward traffic that =
isn't yours.
On a network topology with relatively few router nodes, being a router your=
self also makes you more of a target for attackers who are trying to compro=
mise the network.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Running your own OR provides better end-to-=

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Section 6 of the Tor paper outlines various=
 design choices of Tor and presents some possible risks:=20
- Opportunities for denial-of-service attacks against the network running T=

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Some major risks include that traffic that =

the fact that your computer may become targetted by hostile actors. However=
, running an OR locally makes it much more difficult for other
parties to analyze your traffic since it cuts down one of the entry/exit po=

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Technical risks and benefits of running an =

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Technical risks: An adversary may try to co=

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The benefits of running an onion router Tor=
 node is that you can support privacy rights when browsing the internet. Th=
e main risk, especially if you're running an exit node, but also if you're =
running a relay node, is that it may look like illegal activity is coming f=

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The benefits of running an onion router Tor=

y servers are compromised, then malicious Tor nodes can be included in the =
network.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The disadvantages are that if you're runnin=

The advantages are that you can set your own settings (like what services y=
our node allows connection to) and you can be inherently closer to a servic=

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The risk is that a certain amount of resour=
ce (CPU, bandwidth, etc.) will be taken. In addition, a node is more prone =
to attacks than simply a client. The benefit is that adding a node contribu=

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The technical benefit or running a OR (onio=
n router) Tor node on your machine is that you get increased anonymity, sin=
ce traffic originating from your machine may be your own traffic or it may =
be traffic that is being routed by your OR.

The technical risk of running an OR on your machine is that it may be subje=
ct to attacks. Attackers may try to DOS your machine, or send illicit activ=
ity along your machine to try to frame you and get you in legal trouble.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The technical benefits are you being able t=
o help out clients with their anonymous browsing; either improving their la=
tency or increasing the speed at which they browse. You would also increase=
 the fraction of legitimate Tor nodes in the system and thereby decrease th=
e probability of compromise.=20

Some technical risks include having your machine overloaded with malicious =
traffic (especially if you're listed by the Tor directory as an entry). You=
r machine would also be at increased risk of attacks from attempts to compr=
omise a Tor node. If the client is engaging in any illegal activity and you=
're hosting an exit node, you would be communicating directly with the dest=
ination website. </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The technical risks of running a Tor router=
 node is that you accept connections and route traffic to and from strange =
machines that are only verified with the Tor protocols. If you trust these =
protocols, then you still are allowing potentially criminal traffic to move=
 through your machine. If there is a bug in these protocols, then a machine=
 that is not another Tor node or a Tor client could connect to your machine=
 and run more insidious processes.=20

The benefits of running a Tor node is deniability. If you would like to run=
 suspicious traffic on your machine, you can set up that machine as a Tor n=
ode, and then if anyone asks about this traffic you can believably claim th=
at this traffic does not originate on your machine. </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Tor nodes forward packets containing all ki=

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Tor provides greater anonymity when it has =
more nodes to use for chains, so you would be help make Tor better at accom=

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Tor traffic exiting through the user's comp=
uter would appear to originate from that user's computer. That could expose=
 the user to legal (including criminal) liability for the activities mediat=

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Tor tries to make a node volunteer's job as=
 pleasant as possible, allowing them flexibility in how much bandwidth they=
 provide and what kind of node they want to be e.g. middleman or exit. Bein=
g a node can be kind of burdensome, especially if under attack. A malicious=
 person could accuse the node and shut it down (see exit policy abuse). The=
 node could get backlash for shutting down because it harms the anonynimity=
 of anyone who was routing their traffic through this node, and now needs t=
o spend time rerouting the traffic.

The pro of being a node is free publicity (which may also be a con), as use=
rs must know your IP to route your traffic to you. The paper also claims gr=
eater anonymity for nodes. Also, the more nodes there are in the system, th=
e more people using the system and the more anonymous the system is, so tha=
t's an indirect anonymity benefit for you.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Traffic that leaves the TOR network at the =

will look like the traffic originates from your machine. This might mean
that any malicous traffic will be associated with you and you might receive

The primary benefit is improved anonymity, reducing the risk of end-to-end =
timing attacks.  By using your own node as either an entry or exit node, yo=
u can prevent an adversary from owning both the entrance and exit nodes, an=
d any traffic out of your node could plausibly have come from another sourc=

One technical risk is that your machine is now trying to route a lot of tra=
ffic, and could be subject to `accidiental DDoS' if the various routing alg=
orithms do not work properly to constrain traffic routed through your node.=
  The more salient risk in my mind, but maybe less `technical' is that if y=

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">What are the technical risks and benefits o=
f running an onion router Tor node?

Running the tor node allows the user to be encrypted, it helps guard users =
IPs, you can mix your traffic with relay traffic so a dedicated IP is not r=

ahcine, there could be abuse complaints, some website will ban the IP becau=
