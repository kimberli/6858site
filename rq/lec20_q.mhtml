<li><pre class=3D"student-text"></pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Can exit nodes eavesdrop on communications?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Why were services like Tor originally creat=
ed.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">"But running BitTorrent while doing anonymo=
us web browsing is an especially bad idea. An exit node can find the user's=
 IP address in the BitTorrent payload then trivially de-anonymize all strea=
ms sharing the circuit."

Why is it trivial to de-anonymize all streams from here? Won't all the othe=
r users streams still be anonymized because they have different origins?



</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">- There are several other systems mentioned=
 in Related Work, including those in the same category as Tor. How is Tor u=
nique? Is it the most successful, and why is that?

- What is a censorship-resistant system? How does it relate to public block=
chains?

- What is the difference between circuit and stream level?

- What is a smear attack? Is it in the social engineering category (since i=
t is related to rumors and ruining the reputation of a network)?

- What is the difference between the OR and OP? How do they work together?<=
/pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">1) What makes a Tor node a "trusted" Tor no=
de?
2) Why would someone use Tor in the United States?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">6.858 - Tor

What does the Tor ecosystem look like today? e.g. how many users, routers, =
directories,
etc.?

What does Tor do to prevent a group with large computation power (e.g. Amaz=
on, Google,
the NSA?) from learning too much information by creating lots of routers in=
side
the network?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">&gt; as an optimization, the first two byte=
s of the integrity check
are zero, so in most cases we can avoid computing the hash

What does this mean? What does it mean to have the first two bytes be zero?=
 How does that help avoid computing the hash? Maybe if the first two bytes =
get corrupted, we can avoid computing the hash, but in the common case when=
 the data is uncorrupted, we would still need to compute the hash, right?

Since the paper is from 2004, what improvements have been made to Tor in th=
e meantime? Have the issues with low-latency timing attacks and other end-t=
o-end attacks been addressed? How large is the Tor network today?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Are Sybil attacks possible on the Tor netwo=
rk?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Are there people who use Tor as a "primary"=
 web browser (for viewing all web content, even content that isn't privacy-=
sensitive)? Or does the increased latency and the likelihood that a site bl=
ocks Tor exit nodes make this a non-option?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Are tor nodes banned in some countries?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Can authoritarian countries do anything to =
prevent Tor adoption? I know that China is very paranoid about what citizen=
s can access on the web and I'm wondering if they do anything to prevent To=
r adoption which is popular in the Middle East.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Can the adversary defeats anonymity by obse=
rving the traffic patterns in the network? </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Do most networks use TOR today?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Does CSAIL run a TOR exit node and if not d=
o you know why?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Does TOR also inadvertently provide benefit=
s other distrbuted overlay networks do. One of the ones that comes to mind =
is Resilient Overlay Networks which
try to avoid AS routing issues by allowing traffic to travel along alternat=
ive pathways.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Does TOR use mutual TLS connections between=
 nodes? </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">For the perspective of a company like Googl=
e, which supposedly cares deeply about security, why doesn't Chrome run alg=
orithms like Tor by default to improve user anonymity?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Given the discussion of attacks in the pape=
r, now that TOR is more well-known have their been any high-profile attacks=
 of the type discussed in the paper or otherwise?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Given the risks associated with running an =
onion router Tor node on your machine, how does Tor have enough onion route=
rs to support all of their traffic?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Have there been any examples of Tor users w=
ho've been compromised by law enforcement? It seems that effective end-to-e=
nd timing correlation attacks makes investigations into targeted individual=
s possible.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Have there been any reports of government a=
gencies like the NSA being able to determine where users of Tor are connect=
ing to?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How are duplicate families in the same circ=
uit being controlled now that IPv6 is taking over and disjoint IP address a=
re common?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How are path lengths chosen in practice? Wh=
at is the latency, and have these quantities changed over time since the in=
ception of Tor?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How are traffic confirmation attacks differ=
ent from traffic analysis attacks?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How do websites determine if they want to b=
e run on Tor or the traditional internet?=20

Other than a Tor-supported browser, what do users need to connect? How can =
the number of unique users be understood if everything is anonymous?</pre><=
/li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How does each onion router know if a relay =
packet is coming from the onion proxy's direction?  </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How does having open exit vs middleman vs p=
rivate exit nodes mitigate the issue of anonymous users abusing the network=
?=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How does running a Tor node on the same com=
puter as a Tor client/proxy affect the proxy's anonymity? Would the fact th=
at it's an intermediate node in the network increase the shielding from tra=
ffic analysis attacks (as well as the possibility of directly entering the =
data into the network without the end-to-end attack risk)? Or could it make=
 the traffic less anonymous since it didn't "originate" externally?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How has Tor performed overall today?  Is ha=
s it proven to be robust to adversaries who wish to uncover what data is be=
ing sent through the network?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How has the TOR network changed since 2004?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How has the Tor ecosystem grown in terms of=
 developers, users, et cetera over the years?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How many union routers are there currently =
in the Tor network?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How much more security do you get by adding=
 another node to your circuit? Is there an ideal number, and are there dimi=
nishing returns? I guess it's also important to not have the same number of=
 nodes each time, as that would also reveal information, so how does that f=
it in?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How scalable is Tor? It seems like there is=
n't much incentive to use it unless you believe in the cause. Are there any=
 projects aimed at subsidizing the cost of running a relay (such as by taki=
ng some sort of bit-coin approach...)?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How slow is the Tor network currently?</pre=
></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How was advertising done to get volunteers =
for Tor?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How will Tor continue to scale? It seems li=
ke it relies heavily on volunteers -- how will they incentivize more volunt=
eers besides just security? How has Tor's usage grown?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I find it very odd that Tor requires the fu=
ll network topology to be known, I'd imagine that having every individual h=
ave incomplete view of the network would be more effective at providing ano=
nymity. Why is it necessary for every OR to know the entire topology?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I know that it is still possible to trace s=
omeone through tor, as there have been cases in the past (Silk Road). Is th=
is usually due to faults in Tor or faults on the part of the user?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I once had a conversation with someone at I=
S&amp;T who noted that MIT runs some number of TOR nodes, and gets complain=
ts about the traffic that exits them.  Does that mean that MIT has an open =
exit policy?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I remember reading about how CMU had "broke=
n Tor's anonymity". How did their attack work and has it been patched? Is t=
he design of Tor considered correct and without significant known vulnerabi=
lities (I understand that implementations are hard to reason about)?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I remember when Tor was very talked about b=
ut now it doesn't seem to be as popular. Is there a reason for this? Or per=
haps Tor is still as popular as before and just not as talked about?</pre><=
/li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I still couldn't find the appropriate answe=
r for the question above. Could it be because of this whole hacker-cypherpu=
nk-anarchist ideology that surrounds Tor the reason for why the network is =
so strong/has so many nodes? Are there any precisely concrete benefits of h=
elping the network? Moreover, it seems that exit nodes *are* critical in th=
e final delivery part, which seems to make them potential targets for, say =
the government - couldn't a malicious agent just impersonate/become an exit=
 node and spy?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I still don't quite understand how one can =
protect against a large number of compromized routers, (i.e. a large agency=
 hosting a ton).  What scale of machines serving as Tor routers would be ne=
cessary to meaningfully be able to track someone?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I still don't understand how investigators =
are able to trace certain illegal traffic through the Tor network aside fro=
m having a "spy" participate as a Tor host/relay. I feel like side channel =
attacks would't be effective since so much encrypted traffic goes through t=
he system.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I would like to see more details about the =
Tor design, cells, circuits and streams.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I'm a little confused about how ciruits are=
 created. How do nodes find optimal, or even efficient, paths if they don't=
 know the full topology of the network?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I've mostly heard of Tor in the context of =
doing illegal things online. Is this association well founded?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I've used tor only once or twice, and notic=
ed that the URLs are quite different from normal URLs. From the system the =
paper designed, I don't intuitively see why this should be the case -&gt; f=
rom the client's perspective they are still submitting a normal HTTPs reque=
st. So what is the cause of these very weird URLs? Are these URLs part of t=
he "leaky faucet" and correspond to directly sending a message to an OR?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">If Bob is a user of the TOR network, are hi=
s requests to Alice sent to the same initial OR that the responses are retu=
rned?  Does he send requests and get responses from the same OR, or does he=
 send to one OR and get responses from another?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">If a client sets up their own onion proxy w=
ith a private exit node, can't that node be attributed to them?  How does t=
his help maintain their anonimity?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">If my OR is used to route illegal content, =
is my OR illegal?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">In order to prevent traffic analysis, can t=
he protocol introduce a very small random amount of delay and message paddi=
ng? While this would increase latency, it would increase the anonymity of u=
sers on the network which is one of the main goals
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">In section 10, under Incentives, it says, "=
Volunteers who run nodes are rewarded with publicity..." How is publicity a=
 reward?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">In the 6 years since the set of blog posts,=
 have any new attacks on the Tor network been carried out and has this led =
to any changes in the protocol?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is TOR commercialized for the private use f=
or the companies?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is Tor really anonymous? If government want=
 to trace back
to the user, can it still track a package from the exit node
to the user? </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is Tor still useful for any security purpos=
es? I thought that it had been completely broken...
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is it *only* possible to use timing/volume =
side channel attacks if you control the start and end node, or is it just t=
hat it's less useful to do so otherwise since you'd only be drawing connect=
ions between streams of encrypted traffic?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is it known if TOR is used internally for t=
he government (ie. NSA)? How likely is it that they have something better?<=
/pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is it worth the technical risks of using a =
VPN-then-Tor connection? (e.g. fixed entry node)</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is tor more or less active now than when th=
is paper was published? </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Isn't there a tension between gaining fame =
and reputation from running an OR Tor
node and losing anonymity from running one? Shouldn't there not be an incen=
tive=20
to publicize that you are also an OR Tor node?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">It is mentioned that Tor does not defend ag=
ainst timing attacks. Have timing attacks been a problem for Tor users?

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">It seems like the Tor network attempts to h=
ide some important meta-data from adversaries. However, this hiding is not =
cryptographically secure. Are there systems that achieve such meta-data hid=
ing with cryptographic security?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Lecture 20 (Question About Paper)

The paper mentioned that each onion router maintains a long-term identity k=
ey, which is used to sign TLS certificates, to sign the OR's router descrip=
tor, and to sign directories. When would an OR have to sign a TLS certifica=
te? When would an OR have to sign a router descriptor? When would an OR hav=
e to sign a directory?

The paper also mentioned that each onion router maintains a short-term onio=
n key, which is used to decrypt requests from users to set up a circuit and=
 negotiate ephermal keys. How do users know which key to encrypt their requ=
ests with?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Lecture 20: Anonymous Communication Nick Ma=
tthewson
5/2/18

They mentioned that routing directories were distributed by directory autho=
rities after reaching a consensus, yet wouldn't users betray where they wer=
e located if they had to reach out to the closest directory authority?</pre=
></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Lecture 20: My Tor Question

How much power does anonymity have? I was wondering this because I imagine =
that if I ever get attacked, it would be
because I was randomly selected by some attacker, and not ever targeted by =
someone I know. So in the field of security,
how does anonymity stack up against other qualities, such as performance, i=
nformation security (as in attackers won't
be able to see or access information), etc?

Thank you!
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Other than to sniff messages, why would any=
one want to run an exit node? It also seems like most ISPs won't let you ru=
n one. So who runs these?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Question about TOR

Is it advisable to use a VPN with TOR?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Quinn Magendanz

Lecture 20

What are common mistakes made in configuring TOR clients to use TOR?</pre><=
/li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Scalability of a network seems critical for=
 increased deployment. The paper claims that Tor is expected to support onl=
y a few hundred nodes before it needs to become more distribuetd. What work=
 has been done in designing a more distributed version of Tor?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The Tor paper mentions that Tor is not inte=
nded to protect against a sufficiently powerful, global adversary. What rea=
l adversaries relevant to anonymity fit the more limited threat model Tor c=
onsiders?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The paper briefly mentions website fingerpr=
inting, but I'm not sure how much
that technology has recently changed-- I know that it's possible to identif=
y a
user pretty reliably just based on the fonts that their browser has downloa=
ded.
With this sort of tracking/identifying ability in mind, is there actually a=
 way
to safely browse the Internet as one normally would using Tor? Or must you =
also
limit yourself to only safe websites, running safe languages, etc? Can you
safely run JavaScript in Tor and retain anonymity guarantees?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The paper claims that with the telescoping =
path-building design, the onion replay detection
is no longer necessary. How does the replay detection work originally?</pre=
></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The paper mentioned that a server will main=
tain TLS connections to every other onion router. It is not scalable for a =
large network. If the network is not large enough, the adversary can easily=
 know that the request comes from one of the not many users of Tor. This un=
dermines the property of anonymous. Why do they leave this bottleneck in th=
eir design? </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The paper mentions that an application usin=
g Tor should not do DNS resolution before specifying the destination to Tor=
, and that Mozilla and SSH make this mistake.
It states that with Mozilla, this problem is easy, but with SSH, it is hard=
er.
What exactly are the differences between the two that make this DNS resolut=
ion problem easy or hard?
I don't know enough about their inner workings to see exactly why.

In a compact, haiku form:
Using DNS
before Tor leaks, but only
sometimes a quick fix?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The paper proposes scanning the traffic for=
 common attacks such as XSS and spam, but doesn't it goes against the priva=
cy proposal in the first place? Second, it's possible to mitigate this scan=
ns by using end-to-end encryption, so why even bother?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Tor has gotten a lot bigger since this pape=
r was written. What was done to address the scalability concerns outlined b=
y the authors in section 10?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Tor mentions that few failures occur with d=
irectory servers, but the ones that do would be fixed manually. This does n=
ot seem scalable should Tor
desire to be even more widespread nor does it seem safe to introduce the po=
ssibility of human error to a growing number of directory servers.
Has Tor's stance on directory servers and deriving a consensus from them ev=
olved since the 2012 blog post?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Tor seems to be a very convenient tool for =
online illegal activities due to its hard-to-track nature. How are such act=
ivities prevented?=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">What are main techniques used to track down=
 criminals for crimes committed over the tor network?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">What are other incentives/benefits for volu=
nteers who run nodes other than better anonymity?
