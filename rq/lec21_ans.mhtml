Describe what specific problem might arise if Bitcoin created new blocks
much faster than its current design does---say, every 30 seconds.

------------------------

Currently, the proof-of-work mechanism is needed to give a global ordering =
to
newly mined blocks, and the computational overhead allows the time between =
mined
blocks to be controlled.

This large computational/time overhead prohibits double-spending attacks.
Lowering the time it takes to mine blocks will cause there to be more forks=
 in
the chain, as any latency between the discovery of a block and its receipt
by all other nodes increases the possibility of a temporary fork.
Additionally, if users could mine more quickly, it increases the chances th=
at a party which
controls a significant portion of the network could un-wrap previous layers=
 of
the blockchain to change past transactions and still have time to mine the =
next
block, thus forging transactions.

This is why the original Bitcoin paper specified a 10 minute timeout on blo=
ck
mining.

Question:

Describe what specific problem might arise if Bitcoin created new blocks mu=
ch faster than its current design does---say, every 30 seconds.

Answer:

If this were to occur, then a miner who controls a substantial part of the =
network may abuse network latency in order to only
broadcast his/her forks on the blockchain. This would allow that miner to i=
ncrease their likelihood of receiving the bitcoin
rewards.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">6.858 - Bitcoin

If the computational puzzle took less than 30 seconds (or just less time in=
 general),
then we could be prone to Double spending attacks where attackers spend on =
one branch,
and then quickly spend on another branch and add transactions such that the=
 new
branch is valid. Even attackers owning lots of computational power cannot
parallelize this so it's safe from attackers.=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">&gt; Describe what specific problem might a=
rise if Bitcoin created new blocks much faster than its current design does=
---say, every 30 seconds.

In order for a block to be acknowledged as mined it needs to be propagated=
=20
through the network. If we increase the frequency, we increase the likeliho=
od
of forks occuring, forks might be extended beyond a 1 block length, before
they even have propogated throught the network, making rollback more likely
and more costly.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">A faster block-time in bitcoin, i.e. 30 sec=
onds, would lead to many orphaned blocks and could lead to many empty block=
s. This is because such a block-time increases the likelyhood of forks betw=
een blocks as blocks/transactions require significant real-world time to pr=
opagate. Ethereum addresses this with Uncles.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Answer to Bitcoin Question

With shorter block times, there would be an increased number of forks as it=
 would be quicker to generate a new chain, which would lead to larger incon=
sistencies and less people willing to accept transactions as their block co=
uld easily/quickly be overriden. Furthermore, a larger portion of the hashp=
ower is wasted which leads to less security. </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">As mentioned in the section "Impact on cons=
ensus", a faster target mining time would lead to more frequent forks of th=
e main chain. Given that forks come with some lost transactions, potentiall=
y a large impact if a fork is long enough, increasing the rate of forks wou=
ld lead to potential instability. Along with this, lower target mining time=
 would increase the effect of network latency as the network would need to =
update faster to keep up with the mining rate in order to keep some consens=
us in the mining network.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Because if the rate of solutions is too hig=
h then miners would find redundant blocks before they can be propagated and=
 there will be wasted blocks that give no Bitcoin reward.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Bitcoin currently creates blocks about ever=
y 10 minutes primarily for reasons of network latency. If blocks were gener=
ated faster, miners would frequently find redundant blocks before they coul=
d be propogated. If they were generated slower, it would increase the amoun=
t of time that users need to wait for transaction confirmations.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Bitcoin's rate of block generation is tuned=
 to network latency. If the rate were much faster, this would result in muc=
h more wasted work from miners who find blocks that have already been mined=
 by other miners but have not yet propagated to the rest of the network.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Blocks are mined every 10 minutes and not f=
or a shorter time to avoid the issue of long forks caused by network latenc=
y, as 10 minutes should give enough time to where this is not an issue.</pr=
e></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">By making block creation easier, chains wou=
ld become longer faster. It would be unclear which is the longest fork, and=
 many of the found blocks would be invalidated anyway. This also means that=
 some transactions will be slower.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Creating new blocks faster would allow for =
more transactions but it also means that by pooling resources, it is easier=
 for the main chain to be compromised. Adding more blocks makes it difficul=
t to avoid the effects of short term pooling of resource attacks.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Currently blocks are generated approx once =
every 10 minutes. If this was reduced to only about 30 seconds there would =
be various consequences:
- Number of miners would have to significantly increase to solve the hashes=
 at such a reduced time
- Generating a new solution every 30 seconds would increase the rate at whi=
ch new bitcoins are mined, thus accelerating the pace at which we mine the =
last bitcoin
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Describe what specific problem might arise =

That could lead to double spending vulnerability because the blockchain wil=
l fork
very easily and it will be very difficult for one chain to become longer th=
an the other.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Describe what specific problem might arise =

y, every 30 seconds.

A number of nasty things could arise from new blocks being created many tim=
es faster than they currently do, but the paper specifically calls out the =
fact that the choice of 10 minutes was motivated by a fear of frequent fork=
s occurring if it was much less.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Describe what specific problem might arise =

Fairness isn't guaranteed as a miner holding mining power &gt; 1/3 of the t=
otal might be able to mine ahead of time and withold blocks, effectively mi=
ning unopposed. </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Describe what specific problem might arise =

There would be a higher probability of forks thus increasing the probabilit=
y of double spend attacks. Additionally, the speed in which blocks could be=
 cconfirmed would not change since additional mining power has not been add=
ed.resulting in slower transactions.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Describe what specific problem might arise =

This would mess up the mining incentivization and block reward system. Bloc=
k rewards are created upon finding a valid block and solving the puzzle. It=
 doesn't make sense to create blocks at a set pace like every 30 seconds.</=
pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Describe what specific problem might arise =

Two problems. The network may be flooded with activity. A malicious user or=
 group could rapidly fork the chain and cause a destabilization of consensu=
s on the chain.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Describe what specific problem might arise =

Currently, new blocks are mined about every 10 minutes. Decreasing the time=
 to mine would mean making the computational puzzle easier, and it would be=
come more likely that the blockchain would fork more often. Additionally, m=
iners would find redundant blocks more often because blocks would be mined =
quicker, giving less time for them to propogate through the network. </pre>=

----

If the block creation time is too fast, there could be frequent forks in th=
e block-chain due to network latency. If there's not enough time for all th=
e nodes in the network to accept a new block before another one is created,=
 forks are much more likely.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Describe what specific problem might arise =

If this happens, then a lot of miners/computers are able to compute new blo=
cks and try to append onto the blockchain. As a result, there will be many =
more updates to the blockchain before miners are able to propogate their up=
dated block chain to the others. Now, we have a lot of different block chai=
ns with the same length. To resolve this, miners will be working on many di=
fferent forks and in the end a lot of work will be for nothing, and it woul=
d not be realized until after a long time because these chains can all grow=
 very fast. It also allows an adversary to just make their own chain really=
 fast to override the blockchain, if they start after a check point. Additi=
onally it seems like a lot of bandwidth/energy will be used in discerning t=
he correct blockchain. </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Describe what specific problem might arise =
if Bitcoin created new blocks much faster than its current design does---sa=
y, every 30 seconds.

Temporary frequent forks can be created because the nodes are not aware of =
the new block due to a network latency. Therefore, the overall transaction =
proof time will increase, because all nodes will need to wait until the net=
work becomes consistent.
 </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Describe what specific problem might arise =
if Bitcoin created new blocks much faster than its current design does---sa=
y, every 30 seconds.

There might be more forks in the blockchain from inconsistencies in which b=
lock was added to the chain first. If blocks are added very quickly, then t=
he cost of undoing history to make one consistent chain is higher.=20

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Describe what specific problem might arise =
if Bitcoin created new blocks much faster than its current design does---sa=
y, every 30 seconds.
One problem that might arise if Bitcoin created new blocks much faster than=
 teh current design is that if it were that fast, there would be a higher p=
robability that two different people would find the block at the same time,=
 or within seconds, though only one of them would propogate to have found i=
t.  Further, it would lead to higher amount of fork inconsistency that node=
s would then need to deal with and rectify more often.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Effects of ncreasing the block creation tim=
e -=20
- Increased communication between nodes in the network. Bandwidth increases=
.
- More forks created. Hence, longer reorganization time needed.
- More hashes are generated over the course of the entire generation proces=
s. The security parameter of the hash function would hence have to be incre=
ased to account for this. That in turn will increase the compute required t=
o solve puzzles based on it.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Firstly, having shorter intervals between b=
locks would increase network traffic. Before, broadcasts about the addition=
 of a block happened every 10 min. Under this scheme they occur 20 times mo=
re frequently. So, the bandwidth required to support this system increases.

Secondly, in the 10 minute system there was plenty of time for information =
to propagate through the network and for honest nodes to agree on what the =
longest chain is. With a 30 second goal, this may not be the case. Not only=
 may 30 seconds be too short for a consensus, but 30 seconds is only the av=
erage time. Some blocks may be mined instantaneously. As a result, consensu=
s may not be achieved before a new block is mined in some part of the chain=
, so many forks will be created that eventually have to be abandoned. This =
is inefficient and makes the chain untrustworthy. A higher number of confir=
mations (&gt; 6) would be required before a sale is considered final.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Having a shorter block time could lead to m=
ore forks and longer forks. This could be problematic because many users of=
 bitcoin assume their transaction has been approved if an average of 6 bloc=
ks have been added to the chain after it. If the block time is dropped to 3=
0 seconds, users would have to see many more blocks added to the chain befo=
re they could assume their transaction had been approved. Even then, the gu=
arantee is lowered. This could lead to double spend attacks as well if a fo=
rk grows really long over time. </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I think the main issue would be that when a=
 node has solved the current puzzle and broadcasts the solution, it takes s=
ome amount of time for that to reach all full nodes on the network and for =
them to verify the solution. Having an expected 10 minutes per block added =
means it's much less likely that two nodes will solve the puzzle so close i=
n time that they're both broadcasting solutions at once and other nodes may=
 see one or the other as having solved the puzzle first. With only 30 secon=
ds between blocks, there would probably always be multiple solutions being =
broadcast at once, and then the other nodes on the network have to decide t=
o keep mining on one chain or another. This causes the blockchain to fork u=
ntil one fork gets ahead of the others by enough that all nodes switch to i=
t (the longer this takes, the more work is wasted on the forks that get aba=
ndoned).</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I think the main issue would become consens=
us. 30 seconds is much less time for the bitcoin userbase to decide on whic=
h temporary fork will become generally accepted. It follows that there will=
 be many temporary forks, and as a result, far less consensus.

Another lesser problem would probably be inflation, as now there will be tw=
enty times as many bitcoins created with each block (not counting transacti=
on royalties).
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">If Bitcoin blocks were created every 30 sec=
onds, that drastically increases the probability of long forks happening in=
 the blockchain. Network latency becomes significant in propogating informa=
tion among the nodes, so that makes users a lot less confident about the 'l=
ongest blockchain branch'. Consumer confidence in blockchain will decrease =
because users aren't sure whether the coins are being double spent or not.=
=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">If Bitcoin created blocks faster than it do=
es now (30 seconds compared to 10 minutes), the chain might fork a lot more=
 than desired. When there are forks, the nodes need to reach consensus, whi=
ch will take longer and be more difficult if there are a lot of forks. Also=
, since the blockchain needs to be agreed by every node, if there are too m=
any blocks, it will be even harder to broadcast to the entire network and r=
each consensus. One of the bottlenecks to consensus is network latency, whi=
ch can't be helped. It also helps prevent nodes from withholding blocks.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">If Bitcoin created blocks much faster than =
its current design, then it would run into problems with network latency. S=
ince it may take a while for new blocks to propagate through the P2P networ=
k, a miner with a lot of computational power could mine a long chain unilat=
erally, and then publish the blocks all at once to create a long chain that=
 becomes the main chain.

Even without a malicious user, forks would become much more common because =
the variation between latencies in broadcast would be a significant portion=
 of the time it takes to mine a block, meaning that many miners will mine a=
 given block before any of the hear about others blocks through the peer-to=
-peer network, leading to a plethora of forks.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">If Bitcoin created blocks too quickly, then=
 forks would be more common (because
of the higher probability that a miner will not hear a block before finding=
 a
competing one). If this were to happen, then some of the mining power in th=
e
network would be wasted, and thus 51% attacks would actually take less than=
 51%
of the mining power.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">If Bitcoin created new blocks every 30 seco=
nds, then the rate of solutions is too high and miners will frequently find=
 redundant blocks before they can be propagated.  This will result in too m=
any forks, and make it hard (impossible?) for the public to converge on a s=
ingle longest path.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">If Bitcoin created new blocks faster than i=
ts current design does, then the blockchain would become very long and ther=
e would be a lot more forks because more valid blocks would be found at the=
 same time. </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">If Bitcoin created new blocks faster, the 6=
-block confirmation rule would become less useful, but this is (relatively)=
 easily fixed by clients increasing the number of subsequent blocks require=
d to consider a transaction "confirmed". A bigger problem is that it become=
s easier for an attacker with a lot of computational power to generate mult=
iple, conflicting branches and execute a double-spending attack.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">If Bitcoin created new blocks much faster t=
han it does now, it would be much
easier for people to make blocks. More people would be incentivized to crea=
te
forks and mine off those for Bitcoins, which means that fewer people will m=
ine
the main chain. This decreases the strength of the consensus on the valid m=
ain
chain, decreasing its security.

In a more general sense, if blocks could be mined much faster then Bitcoin =
would
run out of blocks much sooner than 2140. If no new Bitcoins can be created,
there will be no incentive to mine and thus new transactions will not be
validated as often, if at all.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">If Bitcoin created new blocks much faster t=
han its current design (i.e. every 30 seconds), then miners would frequentl=
y find redundant blocks before they can be propagated, leading to frequent =
forks in the blockchain.=20

In this scenario, a miner who is able to control a large portion of the net=
work might be able to favor the broadcast of their own blocks, which would =
increase the likelihood of their fork being the longest version of the cons=
ensus blockchain and thus increasing their mining rewards.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">If Bitcoin created new blocks much faster t=

nce other miners that his fork is the consensus blockchain, thereby dominat=
ing the mining and getting more of the mining rewards.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">If Bitcoin created new blocks much faster t=

ifically, there would be an more frequent forks and more discarded blocks. =
Formal proofs of Bitcoin's stability, such as those provided by LaViola and=
 Garay et all, only hold under the assumption that communication latency is=
 small compared to the expected time to discover a block.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">If Bitcoin created new blocks much faster t=

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">If Bitcoin created new blocks much faster t=

a couple of seconds after and there is a conflict, then only one can be inc=
luded in the blockchain which gets messy. The time delay makes sure the sec=
urity information in propogated through the network.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">If Bitcoin created new blocks much faster t=

The main problem that would arise from decreasing the blocktime to somethin=
g like 30 seconds is the
issue of chain forking, which translates to less security in the system. Wi=
th lower a blocktime, more
miners would solve blocks more frequently, and this would increase the prob=
ability and frequency of
multiple miners (whether malicious or not) confirming blocks and propagatin=
g them throughout the network
simultaneously. This issue means that forks would occur more often and be l=
onger, which puts the system at
risk of malicious users trying to double spend and validating their malicio=
us activity through forks in the
system. In addition, the system would be less efficient as a whole, wasting=
 more computing power as an increase
in the number of temporary forks would cause more miners to spend some time=
 working on those forks until
their node received an update message with the valid branch to work on.

If bitcoin created new blocks at a faster rate, bitcoin would not be scalab=

a block chain that grew at the rate of one block every 30 seconds would not=
 be scalable. </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Suppose you are a business that wants to ac=
cept a bitcoin transaction. You see a block that has been solved by a nearb=
y miner, and other nodes around you accept the block. However, this block i=
s still not safely on the chain, since the only valid chain is the longest =
chain. In some distant part of the world, a colliding block (a block that a=
ppends to the same block that your transaction appended) could have been ap=
pended to the chain. If more miners decide to start mining this colliding b=
lock than your block, more blocks will be appended to the colliding block, =
and your block will no longer be on the chain.

This is a very big problem with cryptocurrencies, and requires some finesse=
 to solve. By setting the difficulty such that there is about 1 block mined=
 every 10 minutes, the network has lots of time to reach consensus on colli=
ding blocks, greatly decreasing the probability that a sequence of blocks t=
hat one part of the network believes are valid are actually on a shorter fo=
rk of the blockchain. If the rate increased to 1 block every 30 seconds, th=
ese collisions would become much more common.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The 10-minute target time is set to give a =
new block time to propagate to the nodes in a network.

If the time was less, first there would be more conflicts as people solved =
the nonce problem at "about the same time", resulting in the creation of ma=
ny forks, maybe never converging to one fork.

Second, the integrity of bitcoin depends on all nodes recognizing the one t=
rue blockchain, so if there were many nodes created a few seconds apart, no=
des wouldn't be able to agree upon which is the one true blockchain and the=
 integrity of bitcoin would be compromised.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The authors say =E2=80=9Cany latency betwee=
n the discovery of a block and its receipt by all other nodes increases the=
 possibility of a temporary fork.=E2=80=9D  A faster block creation time wo=

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The computational puzzle is set and adjuste=
d so that, on average, it takes 10 minutes for a block to be added to the c=
hain.  If this were lowered to 30 seconds, it would cause frequent forks of=
 the chain, as (due to network latency), miners may not learn that a block =
has been found, and submit their own valid block, causing a fork of the cha=
in.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The difficulty of solving the proof of work=
 puzzle to add a block to the blockcahin is artificially increased such tha=
t it takes approximately 10 minutes to add a block to the chain. This is do=
ne so that if there are many more people adding blocks to the chain, the nu=
mber of blocks does not explode. If the time were set to 30s instead of 10 =
minutes, then it would not explode as badly as if there was no approximatel=
y set time limit, but it would mean that more blocks are going into circula=
tion 20 times faster. So, this would not only cause a lessening of the valu=
e of a bitcoin, but would also lead to more duplicate transaction errors be=
cause with the time between blocks being so short, there is more probabiity=
 of blocks being accepted at the same time, thus causing a fork in the bloc=
k chain, which can lead to inconsistent transactions.=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The frequency at which new blocks are creat=
ed impacts the likelihood of frequent forking as miners will race to add ne=
w blocks. Changing the complexity of the computational puzzle so that the f=
requency of block creation is reduced to 30 seconds will likely result in s=
ignificantly more forking -- there will be an increased chance that many fo=
rks will be of similar length and miners won't converge on a single valid c=
hain as the consensus blockchain.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The main advantage of blocks that take a lo=

If blocks were created every 30 seconds, there will probably be a good deal=

blocks found by miners.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The main reason for the difficulty of block=
 mining to be set such that blocks are mined every 10 minutes is so that fo=
rks are minimized. This is accounting for network latency or the time it ta=
kes for all users on the network to hear about a certain mined block. If bl=
ocks could be mined every 30 seconds, blocks would be mined faster than pro=
pagated creating a large number of forks, thus making consensus a lot harde=

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The rate of new block is primarily dominate=

have enough to time to propagate its newly found block to majority of users=

mining. In general, the more miners, the more secure and decentralized a ne=

to warrant concern about large numbers of forks.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">There are a few things that would happen:
  1. The demand on the network would increase, since we would be publishing
  significantly more blocks and thus requiring all miners to incorporate ne=

  2. The chance of two valid blocks being discovered simultaneously would
  increase, meaning that we would have a much higher rate of disagreement o=
n
  the "longest" chain, causing a higher rate of forking/deeper forks before
  consensus is reached.

  3. Deeper forks means a block is "worth" less, i.e. we would want to requ=
ire
  a larger number of "confirmation" blocks before accepting a transaction a=
s
  published.

  4. We would be creating a significantly larger number of Bitcoins, if we
  didn't also adjust the reward for mining a block.

The main thing to be concerned about is that if we didn't adjust other fact=
ors
in the system, e.g. how many confirmation blocks we require, then
double-spending attacks are much more likely, and the load on the network i=

significantly higher.
</pre></li>
