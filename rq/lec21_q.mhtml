<li><pre class=3D"student-text">
What would it take to make bitcoin widely used as international currency?</=
pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">"The size of the block reward is determined=
 by a fixed schedule. Initially,
each block created B50. This has since halved to B25, and is scheduled to
halve roughly every four years until roughly 2140 at which point no new bit=
coins
will be created"

Why does the size of the block reward need to decrease over time?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">1) How does merged mining for alt-coins wor=
k? In particular, what does
"root" mean in the following sentence?

A popular approach is merged mining, whereby an alt-
coin accepts blocks if their root is included in a valid Bitcoin
block, thus enabling Bitcoin miners to mine blocks in the
altcoin without performing any additional work.

2) How much is the reward for mining one block in bitcoins and in dollars
approximately, and how many CPU hours does it take to find one?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">1. How does Bitcoin achieves its worth? So,=
 for example, for the first transaction, who decided the price of bitcoin o=
r how was it decided?
2. How did Bitcoin stop someone from overtaking the network by majority ini=
tially when there were very few miners?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">1. The paper says that hard forks require n=
ear-unanimity. I know that hard forks have occurred in practice; how was ne=
ar-unanimity achieved?

2. Do the developers of bitcoind have the ability to compromise Bitcoin if =
they wanted to? How does Bitcoin promise to address this trust problem if i=
t claims to require no central trusted party?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">5/5/18

Lecture 21

What was the cause of bitcoin's explosion in value about a half a year ago?=
 Was it anything security related?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">6.858 - Bitcoin

For bitcoin, what is generally the time complexity of the puzzle to be comp=
uted?
Is the monetary reward worth the effort to mine? How much is it on major ne=
tworks?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">After 2140 when no new Bitcoin can be mined=
, what will happen to Bitcoin as a
whole? Wouldn't people stop mining due to lack of incentive, and therefore
there would be no ability to maintain consensus and perform transactions?=
=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">After 2140, at which point Bitcoin will not=
 be generated anymore, will the currency still be used? </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Any recommendations for something to read a=
bout the economics of bitcoin? It seems like hype is by far the dominating =
factor in its price, but I'd be curious to see about interplay with other e=
ffects--eletricity price, GPU price, what's the effect of people misplacing=
 flash drives with their wallet keys, etc.?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Are their non random strategies to solving =
the bitcoin puzzle?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Are there any known mechanisms for "distrib=
uted public ledger" systems (such as blockchains) that don't require consum=
ing enormous amounts of computational resources?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">As bitcoin mining becomes more an more comp=
utationally intensive with the number of miners, would larger corporations =
with access to huge amounts of GPUs (ex. NVIDIA) start to invest greater re=
sources into mining (compared to consumers mining with lower grade GPUs)? H=
as this already started?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Beside bitcoin, researchers had developed l=
ots of other "coins". From a technical perspective, this is good because pe=
ople are constantly making improvements and inventing new techniques. But d=
oesn't it deny bitcoin's initiative as a digital currency. Now people are u=
sing blockchain and bitcoin as an investment rather than a stable currency.=
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Bitcoin using their hashing proof-of-work m=
ining as a way to randomly allow
clients to mine blocks in a decentralized fashion. If I made a slightly les=
s
decentralized network, where the only centralized component is a magic serv=
ice
which transmits proovably random numbers at some time interval. Each miner =
has a=20
public numerical ID.

If the miner receives the random number and it is equal to his ID, he can m=
ine a=20
block.=20

Is this functionaly similar to how bitcoin currently works (other than the =
need
of the reliable RNG), or am I missing something?


</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Bitcoin was briefly back at $10,000 per coi=
n. What has changed since 2015 that caused the value of a single coin to ju=
mp that high?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Do people mine other cryptocurrencies or ma=
inly Bitcoin?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Do you think lightning network is a reasona=
ble solution in solving Bitcoin's issue with transaction speed and scaling?=
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Does the "seed nodes" for the P2P network o=
f bitcoin introduce any centralization?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Following the crash of bitcoin, has the foc=
us of research in this area shifted to other cryptocurrencies?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">For Altcoins, I don't understand the Proof-=
of-burn idea. Why does burning
some quantity of bitcoins incentivize users to start using it?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Has any work been done in establishing rewa=
rds that explicitly reward long-term-stabilty?
Have there been any significant changes to block chain since the publicatio=
n of this paper?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Has anyone measured how bad bitcoin is for =
the environment, or what impact it can potentially have on people who *do n=
ot* mine bitcoin (increased electricity costs, increased cloud compute cost=
s)?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Has bitcoin ever been controlled by a major=
ity miner / colluding group?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Have any of the ideas in the "Extending Fun=
ctionality" section been implemented between the publication of this paper =
and now?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Have there been examples of altcoins that v=
aried Bitcoin's magic parameters in a way that resulted in their system's c=
ollapse?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Have you been noticing my haikus?</pre></li=
>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How are lightweight devices like mobile pho=
nes useful to Bitcoin as a whole? Isn't the system mostly dependent on the =
computational power being shared amongst computers? As phones become more p=
owerful, will the idea of Blockchain have to fundamentally shift?</pre></li=
>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How are upgrades to Bitcoin propagated to t=
he other miners? Who determines these upgrades?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How do the other types of cryptocurrency (e=
thereum, litecoin, etc) differ from bitcoin in terms of security?</pre></li=
>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How do you ensure the miners only takes a s=
et amount of fee when creating a block for other people=E2=80=99s transacti=
ons?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How do you protect against someone who can =
compute inverse hashes much faster? For example, someone in 6.857 who can r=
ecreate the entire blockchain because he has a faster algorithm that can co=
mpute inverse hashes 100x faster than most people. Also are the hashes that=
 bitcoin uses invertible with quantum computation?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How does Etherium overcome a network latecy=
 challenge, while it's block time is much less?  </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How exactly do the transaction scripts work=
? The validation and execution processes seem a little hazy.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How exactly does users hiding data in bitco=
in work?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How has the cryptographic currency field ch=
anged since 2014? What are Bitcoin=E2=80=99s biggest competitors, and how d=
o they differ?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How might bitcoin change their hashing prot=
ocol if it were discovered that there was a significant weakness in SHA-256=
?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How profitable is being a manager of a mini=
ng pool?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How will bitcoin maintain consistency witho=
ut miners after 2040?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I am confused on how transaction scripts wo=
rk.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I don't really understand who the miners ar=
e and what the reward is for them. What does it mean they get the ent diffe=
rent between all input and output transactions? I'm a little confused how t=
hese reward transactions occur.=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I find the tension between the rat race of =
miners and the notion of pools
fascinating. Miners join pools to reduce their pay variance, but without
competition many of the bitcoin properties break down. What would happen
if the entire network is a pool? Each miners payout would be exactly
proportional to the contributed compute power, but such a pool would
effectivly be a controlling entity. I wonder if there are better ways
of incetivicing miners, but reducing the need for pools
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I read somewhere about how bitcoin mining i=
s now using an unsustainable amount of energy.=20
How might bitcoin mining be made more energy efficient without compromising=
 the beneficial effect of mining
in the Bitcoin network?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I've heard a common criticism of bitcoin is=
 that mining pools cause the mining process to be somewhat decentralized. 8=
 mining pools control the majority of the mining of bitcoin. Is this a big =
security risk? If these pools combined, could they execute a 51% attack?</p=
re></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">If transactions take a long time to be guar=
anteeded, then doesn't this mean that you can't actually buy anything? Like=
 it would be at a loss on the seller to give the buyer anything because the=
 seller is not guaranteed to get the money. </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is Nikolai Satoshi Nakamoto?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is cryptocurrency a fad that will eventuall=
y die out?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is it possible to set up a malicious mining=
 pool, for example a mining pool which tries to generate adversarial transa=
ctions? How do miners trust mining pools?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is the 10 minute block creation time backed=
 up by calculations and estimates that have held to be true, or is it just =
a standard that was adopted early on and has never changed because of this?=
 Are there groups that strongly advocate changing it?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is the growing size of the bitcoin ledger a=
 problem? How many people use bitcoin wallets and is the failure of those s=
ites a security probblem?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is there a specified algorithm for solving =
the proof-of-work problem, or can anyone use whatever algorithm they want t=
o solve the problem and potentially mine blocks faster than others?</pre></=
li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is there a way to measure the share of comp=
utational power one entity mining Bitcoin has at any one moment?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is there actually any guarantee that the ma=
jority of blocks are verified by good
actors? How do we know that Bitcoin (or any other consensus-based currency)=
 is
not being controlled by a powerful entity (nation-state level)? Couldn't a
powerful group create an altcoin where the truth of the transactions is act=
ually
centrally controlled, while appearing decentralized?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is there any system in place to ensure that=
 people keep working on blocks even after blocks stop rewarding bitcoins?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is there other scenario when someone create=
d something very new and powerful like Satoshi did, and chose to be anonymo=
us?=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is there some way to measure how much minin=
g power a miner controls?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">It is not clear to me how the peer-to-peer =
anonimity scheme is able to provide strong anonimity at all. It seems that =
it might be able to reduce the set of potential sources of the transaction,=
 but, as they describe, it doesn't seem to be a large enough of a network a=
s to be untrackable or even to provide real anonimity of some form.=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Lecture 21 (Question About Paper)

I still don't understand how bitcoin prevents double spending. Suppose a ma=
licious user transferred the same bitcoin to two addresses and both transac=
tions haven't been added to the blockchain yet. What do miners do when they=
 see these two transactions? Do they mark both as invalid and decide not to=
 add them to the blockchain?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Lecture 21: My SoK Blockchain Question

I'm a bit confused on some of the proposed virtual mining schemes. I unders=
tand proof of stake, as it
would directly harm anyone attempting to attack a blockchain operating unde=
r this scheme because they
would need to invest heavily in the blockchain's tokens, so attacking the b=
lockchain afterwards would
depreciate all of the tokens that they collected to run the attack. However=
, I'm a bit confused as to
how the incentives work for the other virtual mining schemes. How exactly w=
ould schemes like proof of
coin age or proof of activity incentivize users to not be malicious?

Thank you!
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Lecture 22: Bitcoin
5/7/18

The paper says to mine bitcoins, a sufficiently difficult computational pro=
blem must be solved. How are these problems generated and is it possible to=
 also add in some actual/real problems (like computing structure of a prote=
in) that needs to solved in research so this computing power is not lost?</=
pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Miners in a pool work together to lower the=
 variance of the rewards. Why don=E2=80=99t miners lie about every correctl=
y figuring out the puzzle in order to gain a share of other people=E2=80=99=
s work without ever contributing value.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">My understanding of the SPV protocol is tha=
t these nodes assume that (1) the past (as dicted by the clients they conne=
ct to) is correct and (2) only valid transactions will be (attempted to be)=
 added to the main chain. I can see this as being a necessary feature for t=
hese nodes to monitor the main chain, but does it actually add any security=
 to the protocol? All they are doing is verifying the PoW is correct, but o=
ther miners would have just as much, if not more, incentive to already chec=
k that thoroughly.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Not directly a computer security related qu=
estion, but what benefit does bitcoin/cryptocurrencies bring? Apart from in=
troducing the idea of a distributed concensus and not requiring a bank to o=
perate it, I don't see how it is of any use.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">On a more general level, since interest on =
cryptocurrencies grew, has research diverted from Bitcoin and instead focus=
ed on other cryptocurrencies? Or has research on Bitcoin itself kept up ?=
=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Once no more Bitcoins will be created by mi=
ning, what will be the primary incentives for miners?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Other than circumventing laws (related to m=
oney laundering, securities fraud,
etc.), do you think that cryptocurrencies have any compelling uses cases fo=
r
ordinary people?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Question about Bitcoin

Have there been attempts to shard the blockchain to make it more distribute=
d/faster but yet still, secure?

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Question: Are hosted bitcoin wallets the mo=
st common way people store their bitcoins? It seems to take care of a lot o=
f the hard parts for the average user, but it also reduces security. What c=
hanges can be made to bitcoin itself to make hosted wallets safer for the u=
ser?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Quinn Magendanz

Lecture 21

What maps bitcoin users to pk usernames, and is it possible to watch that t=
o break anonymity.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">SHA-256 is presumed to be a secure hashing =
scheme in the present and near-future, but if Bitcoin is projected to last =
any significant amount of time (at least until 2140, judging by the block r=
eward size halving schedule), is this still a valid assumption?  Would a br=
eak for SHA-256 or sufficient computing power to render it obsolete lead to=
 trivial mining difficulty?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Since they are losing the race to other cur=
rencies due to the long mining rate, why won't they reduce it?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">So generally the data is still stored on se=
rvers. Which means there is some trusted entity. Is it possible to combine =
ideas from SUNDR to this to at least detect if information is tampered with=
 on these miners. I presume currently the best way to do it is to have mult=
iple sources of consensus, but that also limits the sharding factor you cou=
ld use down to road to improve performance.

Also assuming people conduct very few transactions of their own. I am curio=
us if there is a way to just store your transactions and prove that they ar=
e valid somehow. Like what if there was long term distributed storage but a=
lso faster smaller storage that contained like tid &gt; some hash. And a us=
er could verify balance by checking the hash in the smaller storage.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The Bitcoin paper mentions that if an annou=
nced block contains invalid transactions, participants are meant to reject =
it. What percentage of participants must reject it in order for the block t=
o be considered invalid? What stops an adversary from creating enough users=
 to garner enough votes to not reject it?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The most important question: is it a bubble=
?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The most well-known use cases of Bitcoin th=
ese days, from brokers trading Bitcoins to ransomware asking for Bitcoin pa=
yments, are not really shedding a positive light on Bitcoins. What are some=
 specific use cases today where Bitcoin is being used to help people (other=
 than help them get rich)?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The paper briefly mentions that it would be=
 desirable to have "useful puzzles"
instead of just burning energy on mining puzzles-- are there any promising
proposals for how to adapt Bitcoin to do this, or any promising Bitcoin
alternatives that do this? Why is it that the environmental impact if Bitco=
in
is hardly ever mentioned as a significant negative point in it's design?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The paper brought up the existence of many =
"altcoins" - a term I'd never heard of prior to reading this paper.  If the=
se are spinoffs of bitcoin, how does mining these altcoins make money?  I'm=
 confused as to how they add to the Bitcoin block chain and how they can be=
 used.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The paper discusses the major problems intr=
oduced if a single miner or cooperating group of miners holds the majority =
of mining power. The design of bitcoin mitigates this problem in its curren=
t steady state where gaining majority mining power is infeasible. However, =
how was this problem dealt with during bitcoin's early days? Was it that mi=
ners just did not exploit this flaw due to bitcoin's low value at the time,=
 or was there some systematic fix to this problem?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The paper frequently mentions SPV and SPV p=
roofs - what exactly are those? What should we know about SPV to understand=
 the references to it in this paper?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The paper says that 6 block confirmations i=
s a fairly arbitrary number. Has there been any attempts to bound the proba=
bility of a double spend given n block confirmations? How would one go abou=
t thinking about this analysis? Does this probability increase as the diffi=
culty is lowered (and block time decreased)?

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">There seem to be several components of bitc=
oin that are not fully decentralized (e.g., the need for governance to agre=
e upon the transaction validity rules). In particular, it appears (in secti=
on B, "network topology and discovery") that there are dedicated directory =
servers to seed the discovery of peers.  My question is this - If someone g=
ained control of these directory servers, what kind of attack could they ca=
rry out, if any?

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">This paper is about three years out of date=
 now. As described in the paper, Bitcoin has a deflationary monetary policy=
 -- it is more profitable to hoard the coin than it is to spend it (especia=
lly given its recent volatility). That said, it has not been suffering from=
 the "deflationary spiral" mentioned in the paper. Why?

lockchain and without giving all control over it to a small group of token-=
affluent individuals? (the paper mentions a few "virtual mining" approaches=
 but doesn't really say one way or another whether they might be secure. Th=
ey also mentioned the nothing-at-stake problem which at least some (perhaps=
 more recent) proof of stake methods address (e.g. Ether's where, I believe=
