<h1> 6.858: Questions for lecture 22 </h1>

<ul>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">
How can any encryption scheme be guaranteed to be safe when there is a poss=
ibility that the people running the service have built in a backdoor to acc=
essing the keys.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">1. Can you go over how we can prevent MITM =
attacks when establishing trust?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">1. Could the Ricochet and Pond systems, bot=
h of which are implemented over Onion Routing networks, be combined to prov=
ide all desired privacy guarantees (with the exception of protecting angain=
st a global adversary).
2. In what way is zero-knowledge authentication expensive?
3. Have any significant advancements been made in the space of secure messa=
ging since the release of this paper?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">5/9/18

Lecture 22

What percentage of messaging services use a technique for secure messaging?=
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">6.858 - SoK

Has google/other large email servers adopted forms of privacy/security crit=
eria outlined
here?

Why does it think that adoption for email is easy? How do different email s=
ervers
negotiate their protocols if they differ?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">According to the paper, one round of a DC-n=
et-based protocol works by having some participants submit messages, and th=
en everyone receiving the xor of all the messages.
Doesn't this mean that no one actually sees any of the secret messages, but=
 instead some garbled xor of all of them, making for a not very effective m=
essaging scheme?
I'm pretty sure I'm missing something here, but I don't know what it is.

In a compact, haiku form:
How do DC-nets
properly send messages?
The paper seems sparse...



A final note:
To all the course staff, thanks so much for all the work you've put into th=
e class this semester.
A lot of the papers were very interesting and covered a wider variety of to=
pics than I expected coming into this class.
The labs were also very fun and instructive, and I wish I could do them all=
 again.
Would recommend.

In a compact, haiku form:
I've loved all the labs,
readings, and haikus from this
10 out of 10 class.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Almost all of these anonymous systems are a=
lso abused for illegal activity e.g. BitTorrent for pirating, Bitcoin for b=
lack market stuff, Tor for similarly illicit stuff I'm sure. What are the e=
thics of doing research on systems that provide full anonymity?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Although academic research on secure messag=
ing hadn't really increased, has there at least been more inclusion of the =
ideas mentioned in this paper in actual programs?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Although it is not likely that there will b=
e a single messaging system that meets every requirement in the paper, have=
 messaging systems created since its publication improved?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Are there any currently widely used messagi=
ng services that implement the schemes described in the paper?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Are there any practical approaches to provi=
de strong transport privacy properties against global adversaries?

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Are there other programs that use onion rou=
ting besides TOR?=20

It also feels like a lot of this security also depends on the user's willin=
gness to conform to these measures.=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">As I wrote the answer to question for this =
lecture, a question came up: why is it that there's no set up system on,say=
, the protocols of email
or of the internet itself so that updates are easier to deploy and so on? O=
f course, it is all distributed and requires updating each node of the grap=
h and so on - but
shouldn't it be simple to implement a number of protocols such that, once a=
 given update is available, it is simply spread through the graph?=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Besides blockchain based, are there existin=
g PKI schemes that make use of fees or economic incentives.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Could you give an overview of a PIR impleme=
ntation? Just curious.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Did the NSA revelations empirically inspire=
 more development of secure end-to-end messaging systems?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Do large companies like Google and Yahoo im=
plement additional security protocol to make their emails more secure?</pre=
></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Do services like keybase, which tie public =
keys to social media identities, solve a lot of the problems of key sharing=
 / discovery? It seems like they root trust at the level of social media (v=
erification stamps on accounts) but on services like Twitter and Instagram,=
 this is almost like a community intelligence level of trust, since many pe=
ople will follow and attest for the authenticity of an account.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Email seems to do well in the adoption cate=
gory, the only things it fails is no additional service and it it=E2=80=99s=
 not spam/flood resistant. It also does well in the usability category but =
it doesn=E2=80=99t provide any of the privacy features such as anonymity. T=
he other suggestions include using onion-routing and blockchain message bro=
adcast, but these would require major changes to how email is currently sen=
t, especially the blockchain method, since that requires broadcasting messa=
ges to everyone.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Facebook Messenger is getting more and more=
 advance features and is probably the most complex messenging application. =
How will messaging security change to these features? </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Given the popularity of new messaging apps =
like WhatsApp, Facebook messenger, and slack, what is the likelihood that e=
mail is replaced entirely in the future? </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Has any work been done which utilizes the a=
nalysis made by this paper?
Also, their goal was to "create a guide for the research community to help =
move forward on this important topic." This seems incredibly subjective bas=
ed on what they're prioritizing. I'm curious how common it is for papers to=
 have similar goals, and whether these papers do often affect the course of=
 a research community.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Has anyone really implemented a blockchain =
based messaging system? If so why?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Has it become easier to adopt the blockchai=
ns scheme since there have been a lot of research on blockchains recently?<=
/pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Has secure messaging raised any legal debat=
es, such as regarding rules of discovery?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Has the framework for evaluation of secure =
messaging been used on other computer systems as well?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Have email usage patterns changed recently?=
 Do people still use email as much as they used to a few years ago? </pre><=
/li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Have revelations about NSA surveillance led=
 to actual improved security changes in email?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Have there been any studies on how the perc=
eption of messaging security by end-users has changed over time? For exampl=
e, does the average user today care more about messaging security than the =
average user 10 years ago?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How are deniability and authentication mutu=
ally compatible? The paper only discussed this briefly.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How are the speaker consistency and message=
 repudiation properties supposed to
work together? On one hand it seems like we want to be able to determine th=
at=20
messages are from a specific speaker, yet we don't want to give any evidenc=
e that
some message must have been sent by some user.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How can developers overcome the lack of tra=
nsport security?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How can we make the average user care more =
about security? If users already cared about privacy then we wouldn't be us=
ing the same insecure emails that we all use today. It seems to me that we'=
ve been trained as a society not to worry about privacy and the only way to=
 convince someone to care is with fear/threat of getting their data stolen.=
 However, this threat does not resonate with a large majority of the popula=
tion who can not really imagine why being surveilled would be a risk to the=
m.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How common is it labs to devote so much tim=
e to analyzing specific topic and publishing analysis of the field without =
actually inventing anything/doing any research?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How do modern providers make massive change=
s to a system without temporary down-time for their millions or billions of=
 users?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How does DC net work? If participants only =
recieves XORs of all the messages, how does each participant recover indivi=
dual message?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How does Facebook Messenger fare in this ev=
aluation?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How does iMessage achieve its security/usab=
ility features?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How does the newer Signal app compare to it=
s predecessor, TextSecure, for secure messaging?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How does the participant repudiation work? =
It seems that if a participant can deny that they wrote the message (the me=
ssage can be forged by other participants), then it means that users who us=
e the system won't know who they're talking to, since the messages can be f=
orged? How does repudiation and authentication work together? Why would the=
 proof convince the people communicating but not outsiders?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How likely is it that new, more secure mess=
aging apps will overtake use of email?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How much do external factors such as networ=
k effect contribute to the delayed
adoption of secure messaging protocols and applications?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How much has email security changed in the =
past ~10 years and how much do you think it will change in the next ~10 yea=
rs?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How reasonable are these properties exactly=
? Sure things don't explicitly protect against these properties, but for st=
uff like forward or backwards secrecy, that depends on someone else finding=
 out your secret key which doesn't seem very likely. Especially if it is no=
t revealed to the user, and it is implemented correctly. I feel like of the=
 apps out in the wild, a lot won't satisify these strong properties simply =
because it is a lot to ask for at the price of seemingly very little gain. =
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How secure is Facebook Messenger?</pre></li=
>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I actually don't really understand why emai=
l and messaging are different... why dont people make an interface for emai=
l thats just like messenger if email is more secure? If email is less secur=
e, why does anyone use it?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I don't really understand key revocation. W=
hy would we ever revoke a key? If the key is compromised, wouldn't that mea=
n the attacker already has access? Or is this like an OKWS kind of approach=
 where we just try to minimize the damage.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I found the extended version of the paper q=
uite interesting
http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/techreports/2015/cacr2015-02.pdf especially
since they discuss Web of Trust implementations like keybase.

From personal experience Keybase gets many things in terms of usability tig=
ht,
but it is kinda missing integration with other tooling.

What are your recommendations for secure messaging?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I'm confused by forward secrecy and backwar=
d secrecy - can you explain what each of them mean, and the different threa=
t models they encompass?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I've heard a lot about the app "Signal" in =
the context of modern secure
messaging apps.  How does Signal stack up to the criteria laid out by the
authors?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">If WhatsApp messages are truly unreadable b=
y the transportation media (network, server, etc), what did Facebook have t=
o gain through purchasing them?  I guess it would have to be metadata minin=
g?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">If people were willing to have their email =
addresses be public keys, could we have a secure email system by just encry=
pting (client-side) any message with the recipient's public key, then when =
they receive the message, they can decrypt (client-side) with their private=
 key? This seems like it could be added easily on top of existing email inf=
rastructure (as far as the email provider is concerned, nothing has changed=
; your message just looks like a mess). Users already need to know each oth=
ers email addresses in order to send messages, so having the address itself=
 be the public key would mean there's still only one piece of information n=
eeded. The obvious downside is that instead of `my_name@mit.edu`, I'd have =
to be something like `jk8OIJADLFJK98ouaksjdf1aosidfj3OIJAD...@mit.edu`. Thi=
s would certainly hinder adoption; I wouldn't want to tell you my email add=
ress, but you could easily copy-paste it into your contacts from, e.g., a t=
ext message. The encryption/decryption itself could perhaps be done with a =
browser extension so that there's no difference to the user (then you have =
to trust the extension, but hopefully the code isn't too long and open-sour=
ce).</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">In schemes with central servers, how come o=
nly the intended recipient can read the messages?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">In terms of doing encrypted email, is it an=
y different than sending messages?
In the past I've used chrome extensions for key management and used encrypt=
ed
email. Its slightly more low-level  than a messaging app, but still does th=
e
same thing.=20

Also, do most of the messaging protocols just use public-key encryption for
encrypting contents of the messages? Or do they use the public-keys for
distributing symmetric keys? When I used keys with email, it was encrypting=
 the
email text with the public/private keys.

PS:
Thank you for an amazing semester, I have really enjoyed this class :)=20

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is this evaulation scheme actually used? Ar=
e there more things that are important when it comes to privacy in messagin=
g that was not discussed?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">It sounds like Signal / TextSecure gets hig=
h praise, and Whatsapp uses the same protocol.  Do you happen to know what =
Telegram uses?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Just like the Internet was not designed wit=
h security at the forefront, email lacks many security properties desireabl=
e as
a reliable communication scheme. However, just like the Internet, it is ver=
y widely used. Given the footprint of email,
it would seem easier to have common email clients like Gmail and Yahoo to i=
ncorporate desireable security features
than it is to change protocols on the Internet. Has progress been made in t=
his area, especially given the focus people
tend to put on emails?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Lecture 22 (Question About Paper)

What were the primary design goals of email?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Lecture 22: Email Messaging Security
5/9/18

Emails have unecrypted headers containing information about the sender/reci=
ever along with some metadata, and this is a privacy concern. However, it s=
eems as if companies/Google uses this header information, so there doesn't =
seem to be much motivation for them to stop using headers?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Lecture 22: My SoK Messaging Question

How exactly do zero knowledge proofs work?

Thank you!
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">New messaging systems have a common challen=
ge of adoption regardless of the security and privacy features offered, bec=
ause of a strong network effect. Can you please briefly share the major cha=
llenges, which vuvuzela.io project has gone through?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Of the common messaging services used today=
 (messenger, whatsapp, iMessage...), which hold up the best against the cri=
teria in the paper?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Puncturable Encryption has all of the desir=
able adoption properties in Table 2. It wasn't clear to me from the paper w=
hat exactly this is and how it could be used to provide secure communicatio=
n.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Question about Paper:

This is a bit of an aside from the paper, but I saw that Prof. Zeldovich is=
 working on Vuvuzela, a private messaging app and would be interested in he=
aring more about what security guidelines/ideas they've used in creating th=
e application? </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Question: Why is destination validation imp=
ortant for conversation security?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Quinn Magendanz

Lecture 22

Who are the key actors who would need to agree to make changes to existing =
SMTP and SMS protocols?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Signal has recently had some issues with ce=
nsorship after its service providers
(AWS and formerly Google) decided that they do not want to allow domain
fronting. Do you think that this is an isolated incident or could it reflec=
t a
larger trend of large tech companies backing away from support of end-to-en=
d
encrypted messaging systems.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Some methods such as blockchain-based messa=
ging seem irrelavant and not even remotely feasible. The authors seem to sh=
are this sentiment, but what are some of the weirdest messaging schemes tha=
t people have implemented?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">THe paper talks about key exchange and evol=
ution schemes such as Authenticated Diffie-Hellman,
Diffie-Hellman ratchet, Double Ratchet and 3-DH Handshake etc. Which of the=
se is used in the
popular messaging systems? Why?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The authors mention many problems being the=
oretically solved but industry has not adopted these solutions because deve=
lopers do not know about the solution or just cannot see a way to implement=
 them. Would employing these academics in industry help with these issues? =
Are there companies that employ strategies like these (ie. Google, Microsof=
t) and do they have luck in these areas?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The elusive question of adobibility kept st=
anding out to me while reading this paper. The authors once mentioned in a =
talk that over 100 other messaging alternatives currently exist (not even i=
ncluding the big names Gmail, Facebook, WhatsApp, etc). Why do smaller mess=
aging services keep investing so much time/resource to developing a messagi=
ng platform when in the end 99% of end users probably don't care about data=
 encryption or even if they do then they keep their old (not secure messeng=
er)? Additionally if the technology that they propose is so ideal in terms =
of security it just seems like the big corporations will simply implement t=
heir algorithms on their existing platforms (gmail, facebook).=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The language this paper uses seems to focus=
 a lot on crime and preventing authorities from finding out or linking iden=
tities. Why/is this normal language for the field? I feel like earlier pape=
rs had a slightly less guilty tone.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The paper heavily discusses the tradeoffs b=
etween security and usability. Is there a point in the future where the pop=
ulation could be mobilized to adapt to perhaps less usable protocols but th=
at provide better security?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The paper mentions that "there is little ev=
idence suggesting that academic research on secure messaging has dramatical=
ly increased". Why is that the case? Is it because secure messaging is most=
ly a (theoretically) solved problem, making further work less interesting?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The paper mentions that Axolotl hasn't been=
 thoroughly evaluated in an academic
context. What exactly does 'thoroughly evaluated' mean, here? Have any
messaging protocols actually been proven to be secure, e.g. through formal
verification?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The paper mentions that some cutting edge s=
ystems like iMessage are completely
proprietary. However, does Apple (or whatever other company) make any claim=
s about

, if the
app is the most secure.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The paper's concluding remarks state that "=
an open standard for secure messaging, combining the most promising feature=
s identified by our survey, would be of immense value." Since this paper wa=
s published in 2015, has there been any work on open standards for secure m=
essaging? The paper mentions TextSecure, which has now become Signal, as an=
 open source protocol that fails to facilitate interoperable implementation=
s. What would it take for an open source platform like Signal to become an =
open standard for secure communication?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The question is not really related to the p=
aper's content. But I am really curious. Is this paper useful to the resear=
chers' community?

I feel like the paper is a broad survey on existing solutions. And I think =
it is most beneficial to people not familiar with this area. Since the pape=
r was written in 2015, some of its ideas/beliefs are not up-to-date. Should=
 people write this kind of paper every 5 to 10 years to keep up?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">This paper does not talk much about spam an=
d security. As long as we have end-to-end encryption and decryption, the se=
rvice provider can no longer filter spams. Even if they build a filter in t=
he user-side app, it's easier for an attacker to work around. How do existi=
ng systems do anti-spam?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">This paper is (in my opinion) both difficul=
t to parse through because of the ordering, and also fairly uninteresting. =
It also seems like the conclusions are kind of the same as usual: most user=
s won't willingly deal with security that is more inconvenient. Is there so=
mething more to this paper I am missing?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">What are reasons that a company would choos=
