I imagine it's easier to use (no chance of losing or damaging the

some other software configuration).

Depends on what you mean by failure.  If it fails outright, then no
requests get in, because in the architecture described in the paper,
GFE is responsible for converting incoming requests into RPCs into the
appropriate service.  If it fails to mitigate a DoS attack, then the
DoS attack's requests get forwarded to whatever service they're send
towards, and that service might or might not be capable of handling
them.

That's correct -- in both cases, Google prompts the person (be it an
adversary or a legitimate user that purchased a new device) for
additional information.  I'm not sure what you're saying about this
situation, though.  It seems like asking for additional information in
this case does make it more difficult for an adversary to gain access
