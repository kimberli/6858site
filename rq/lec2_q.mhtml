<li><pre class=3D"student-text"># Lecture Question L2
# Rayden Y. Chia

Is Google's change management process fully automated with minimal human in=
tervention, or does it rely on some human checks?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">1. Can you go over the RPC protocol part (A=
ccess Management of end user data section) once in the class? I didn't unde=
rstand that part that well.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">1. Google uses load balancers to avoid DoS =
attacks. But what if=20
the load balancers are attacked? Is there any particular way to
protect load balancers?=20
2. How does Google ensure its codebase can't be stolen by others?
As Google is becoming a huge company and everyone can access the
codebase.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">1. Security is a comprehensive problem and =
ubiqutous problem. I'm inetersted how does Google prioritize its security a=
ctivities taking into account the scale of its operations.
2.    </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">1. What are the planned interactions betwee=
n the machine, service, and employee identitiy objects in "Inter-Service Ac=
cess Management" section?
2. How are API's designed securely separately from the system infrastructur=
e?
3. How might Google protect against a DoS attack against the =EF=BF=BDend u=
ser permission ticket=EF=BF=BD verification process?=20
4. How can Google be confident that they continue to scale up to allow them=
selves to absorb many attempted DoS attacks?
5. Why would other companies/services want to partner with Google for Unive=
rsal 2 Factor auth?=20
6. What percentage of security flaws would Google expect their Red Teams to=
 find in contrast to like the paid 3rd party hackers? </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">&gt;&gt; "Hardware Design and Provenance
A Google data center consists of thousands of server machines connected to =
a local network. Both the server boards and the networking equipment are  c=
ustom-designed by Google"

What real kind of custom-designing does this entail? This seems to be marke=
ting jargon? The line that follows this seems much more feasible -- of plac=
ing checks in the process of selecting vendors and the equipments they sell=
.
"We vet component vendors we work with and choose components with care, whi=
le working with vendors to audit and validate the security properties provi=
ded by the components." So is this the real cusotm-designing that they refe=
r to?

-----
&gt;&gt;"When an end user deletes their entire account, the infrastructure =
notifies
services handling end user data that the account has been deleted. The
services can then schedule data associated with the deleted end user accoun=
t
for deletion."

Google innocuously mentions that this is the process it follows in deleting=
 user information. From a user's security standpoint (and not the perspecti=
ve which is dominant in this document, namely, of Google's), how can one be=
 assured that the promise made by Google is actually implemented, and that =
there's no residual data that's left behind in their system? What if there'=
s a bug in their deletion system? Should companies move towards publishing =
COQ equivalent designs/proofs of their internal semantics as a first step? =
That still won't assure having followed the semantics during implementation=
. What's the right way out then?
-----
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">A lot of the processes depend on a two-part=
y authentification system - is this enough? It seems that if an attacker co=
uld compromise an account, they might also be able to get the account of a =
second party needed to authenticate.=20


</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Are Google's "custom chips" still affected =
by Meltdown/Spectre? If so, how do they protect against those security flaw=
s from being exploited?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Are there any negative side effects of publ=
ishing Google's security practices online for everyone to see? Is it possib=
le for a malicious attacker to read through this security design and be mor=
e well informed of how to successfully attack Google (or perhaps a smaller =
less secure company)?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Are there known attacks that have been moun=
ted against Google in the past? In general, was this system developed by fo=
llowing security principles, or by responding to threats?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Chrome doesn't do this anymore, but I remem=
ber that it is used to store your passwords in plaintext so anyone with acc=
ess to your computer could view all your passwords with minimal effort. I w=
as very surprised to see the contrast between allowing this vulnerability a=
nd the amount of effort put into to secure their infrastructure. Do we have=
 to think about security differently when it comes to end users than infras=
tructure?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Could Google's various open-source projects=
 reveal vulnerabilities to Google's security measures, and have those vulne=
rabilities been exploited?=20

Reading 1

What part of Google's extensive security system is its weakest link, and ho=
w does Google respond to attacks on this part?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Discussing DoS attacks, the paper describes=
 how "at the next layer, the GFE instances also report information about re=
quests that they are receiving to the central DoS service, including applic=
ation layer information that the load balancers don't have"

What are some examples of application-level information that would be valua=
ble to the DoS service?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Do companies ever sacrifice security for th=
e sake of usability? It sounds like some of Google's precautions (for examp=
le checking if the user is logging in from a reasonable location) slow down=
 the usage process and add overhead, but at the same time it does sound lik=
e a good precaution to take. I guess I'm wondering if there's such a thing =
as too much security or if "better safe than sorry" is what all companies a=
dhere to.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Do most companies follow the Google method =
of 'scheduling' data for deletion? Obviously it is nice to have the option =
of recovering something that is accidentally deleted, but it might create a=
 false sense of security when a user is trying to delete particularly sensi=
tive information - something that would be wiped right away.

On a side note, is it possible to 'write' to a disk in such a way that you =
nomially write over a region of the disk, but don't actually change anythin=
g there, thus giving yourself access to whatever bits were set in that regi=
on before (and possibly allowing you to recover the data previously stored =
there)?


</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Do you think that Google puts private backd=
oors in some of their software? Does this generally happen in the industry?=
 Does a private backdoor make software less safe?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Does Google use formal verification to ensu=
re the security of any piece of its infrastructure? Is there any piece of i=
ts infrastructure so critical that it would benefit from that degree of eff=
ort?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Does Google use homomorphic encryption duri=
ng cloud operations to protect users' privacy?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">For finding vunerabilities in software, wha=
t are good tools to approach this problem algorithmically? (Is fuzzing stan=
dard practice, and how exactly does that help find areas of exploitation?) =
 </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Given that this paper was last updated in J=
anuary 2017, do you think there have been anything that has emerged in the =
past year that would/could result in a large change/addition to the policie=
s that have been described?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Google Security Design Question

I noticed in this paper and have noticed in many other papers that encrypti=
on is
used far and wide as a security buzzword to assure readers that a certain p=
rocess
is undoubtedly secure. However, is there a universal encryption standard? D=
o all
companies use the same level of encryption? If not, just how different are =
varying
encryption qualities and what kind of overhead do they each have?

Thank you!
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Google mentions specifically how they revie=
w and test KVM both automatically and by hand as that appears to be a signi=
ficant dependency of theirs, so any security flaws there affect them. Do th=
ey write almost everything else in-house or are they able to scale this pro=
cess of manual inspection + automatic testing (static analysis, etc.) to al=
l libraries that they use either directly or indirectly (as dependencies of=
, e.g., KVM)?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Google puts a lot of effort into protecting=
 customers' information. For example, it destroys the decomissioned SSDs if=
 there are any traces of data. What about the opposite case? An SSD is bein=
g destroyed/faulted/stolen - what do they do to preserve the customer's inf=
ormation without violating the security?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Google seems to say that they mainly rely o=
n scale for absorbing DoS. If there was a natural disaster and one of Googl=
e's main data centers went down, would what they have as backup be enough?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Google uses machine intelligence on top of =
data processing pipelines in order to warn of possible incidents -- what so=
rt of signals indicate a potential incident?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How are =E2=80=9Cmore secure=E2=80=9D hardw=
are components chosen and spec=E2=80=99d out? Are they usually just looking=
 for how physically breakable or scratchable a chip or disk is or are there=
 other factors?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How can isolation between VMs using hardwar=
e virtualization break down? Why are they isolated?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How common are companies breeched by using =
a malicious piece of hardware (do we even know?)

Have there been any attacks that aim to beat out security chips of any sort=
?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How do large organizations such as Google c=
ome up with new potential
attack vectors they need to address?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How do metal detectors increase the securit=
y of physical premises?

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How do organizations that do not have the t=
remendous resources Google assure that their hardware does not have any bac=
kdoors without creating it themselves (especially against national state at=
tackers like the NSA)? </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How does Google determine if certain parts =
of libraries are safe to use=20
security wise? It seems like it can be the case that rather innocuous detai=
ls
can lead to large security problems. </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How does Google ensure they have active fee=
dback in their security measures?=20
I imagine the types of attacks that are common now may be very different ne=
xt month or next year, and they need some mechanism to optimize their engin=
eer's time.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How does a load balancer help with a DDoS a=
ttack by dropping/throttling users without affecting too many people? If th=
e attack has a sufficiently high number of machines performing the attack, =
it seems difficuly to distinguish it from normal traffic.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How does a trust chain work? How is an iden=
tity assigned to hardware? I understand that certain sofware components can=
 store a "cryptographic signature". How is this stored? </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How does encapsulating application layer pr=
otocols (such as HTTP) inside infrastructre RPC mechanisms work?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How does google go about deleting data "sch=
eduled for deletion"? Do they have steps to make sure that deleted data sta=
ys deleted?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How does google respond to security breache=
s when they happen? For example, does google immediately shut down the infe=
cted service? Does google let affected users know that their security may h=
ave been breached? </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How is verification of cryptographic signat=
ures implemented for the BIOS, bootloader, kernel, and operating system ima=
ge? Can this system be spoofed
by bad actors?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How much additional latency, cost (in hardw=
are and engineers), and time
does it take to maintain this level of security at seemingly every layer
of their infrastructure? I'm wondering what the utility benefits are for
this additional work and how Google goes about deciding how much effort
to put towards security relative to other tasks engineers can do.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How much does the process of software devel=
opment slow down due to the fact that only the owner of a service can grant=
 it access to communicate with other servers? In general, is the process of=
 getting permissions from the right people slow?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How much of a performance impact does encry=
pting all communications between machines have?  Is it negligible or not re=
ally as Google has to build their own hardware specific for encryption?</pr=
e></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How much of a real threat are physical atta=
cks, given that there is an entire subsection devoted to them? Have there b=
een any high-profile ones recently?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How to efficient detect attackers who bypas=
s all the security controls and gain access to some sensitive data? Althoug=
h we can log everything, it's still hard to discover these attackers from n=
ormal users before they cause any damage.=20

There are still some websites or smartphone apps transmitting passwords on =
unencrypted network flow. Is there a way to enforce all websites hosting on=
 google cloud to securely transfer sensitive data? Is it safe to store unen=
crypted passwords database on a google cloud server since all the data are =
already encrypted by google? What kinds of security problems should develop=
ers consider when they deploy a website on google cloud?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">How worrisome is the physical threat of peo=
ple attempting to access data centers? If credible, how effective are the c=
ountermeasures mentioned against unwanted access?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I don't quite understand the difference bet=
ween the encryption mentioned in the "Service Identity, Integrity, and Isol=
ation" subsection vs in "Encryption of Inter-Service Communication". Does t=
his mean a communicated message is encrypted twice; once at the application=
 level and another time at the network level?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I noticed Google's layers of security don't=
 map perfectly onto the idea of a technology stack as I'm used to thinking =
about it, e.g. placing storage and communication "above" or "below" one ano=
ther seems arbitrary, but the language of the paper implies the ordering is=
 deliberate and meaningful. Why are the middle four layers in particular ar=
ranged the way they are?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I thought the paper was very well written a=
nd not very confusing (probably for
the sake of better security). They also provided links at the end for furth=
er
readings which answered most of my questions. I do wonder what would be dif=
ferent about the
cloud security section if it was written after the spectre/meltdown attacks
were found. Would anything change (like more isolation), or would they just
disable the features that allow the attacks and move on?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I would think that publishing some details =
of your security measures might give attackers an advantage when they are t=
hinking about how to compromise your systems. How do companies like Google =
balance sharing information that might help others with the need to keep as=
pects of their security measures secret from potential attackers?</pre></li=
>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I've heard people talk about Google falling=
 prey to not-made-here syndrome, in
that they take major efficiency and quality hits from being too reluctant t=
o
use third-party services. Are there advantage to making everything in-house
besides just being privy to all of the implementation details, from a secur=
ity
standpoint?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">If Google uses its automated process and de=
tects security bugs in the developed source code, how does it determine whe=
ther the developer inserted the bug intentionally or it is purely an overlo=
oked bug? Since this is a quite important decision that is related to futur=
e threats. </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">In "Keeping Employee Devices and Credential=
s Safe", it mentions that Google has replaced the use of "phishable" OTPs w=
ith U2f security keys. Why are OTPs insecure against phishing attacks, and =
how are Google-developed U2F security keys more resistant to phishing attac=
ks than OTP second factors?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">In the Denial of Service Protection section=
, it describes a series the Google Front End
and a series of hardware and software load balancers. How does having servi=
ces use
the Google Front End help with DoS attacks and how does throttling help wit=
h this as well?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">In the Google Front End Service subsection =
they mention that GFE ensures that all TLS connections are supporting perfe=
ct forward secrecy. What does this entail?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">In the section "Intrusion Detection", it sa=
ys that incident and investigation teams respond to potential incidents all=
 hours of the day. How small could a potential incident be and what exactly=
 is the "machine intelligence" that is used to trigger a warning?</pre></li=
>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Is there anyone high up enough who can actu=
ally view private data when they want to? Or could a couple of insiders wor=
k together to access private data (e.g. give each other permission, disable=
 infrastructure hooks)?=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">It appears that U2F compliant devices are p=
hysical usb disks that contain private keys. Would it be possible to physic=
ally steal someones U2F device and load malware on it that runs when an emp=
loyee attempts to authenticate and perhaps create a virus that loads itself=
 onto any further U2F devices plugged into that machine?=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">It seems like Google Compute Engine relies =
on a hardened KVM to isolate customer processes. What does a KVM exploit ty=
pically look like? What are ways (current or in the past) to escape a sandb=
ox like KVM?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">It seems like there's a particular extra le=
vel of risk when Google is running client code (e.g. GCE) on its machines. =
What extra security measures does it take on that code, if any, parallel to=
 the operational security measures for safe software development for its ow=
n employees?
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">It seems that many of these problems are pr=
oblems that should be addressed in
general, but the document makes several explicit references to internal Goo=
gle
services (BigTable, Borg, etc.).

Are there any particular attacks that Google must be more careful to guard
against due to this specific infrastructure and more generally, Google's sc=
ale?
</pre></li>

Lecture 2
Question

What does "smart reverse-proxy front end" mean in general? I assume it enco=
mpasses everything the GFE takes care of but I don't understand that termin=
ology.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Lecture 2 (Question About Paper)
Jorge Troncoso

What type of attacks is Google trying to prevent by "scheduling data for de=
letion"? Are they trying to give customers an opportunity to recover their =
data if an attacker manages to delete their data?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Lecture 2: Security Architecture
2/12/18

In the section about intrusion detection, they mentioned using "monitoring =
points" in the infrastructure, but what does that entail? These points must=
 include access and reading of data, but would they also just authenticate =
all the users on the internal network at intervals/how else/that's pretty h=
igh cost?</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Not a question about the article per se. Du=
ring my internship at Google last year, we had training on security (the in=
formation was similar to the information in the article). The employee gues=
t policy was that it is the employee's job to keep a watch on their guests =
and make sure not to let them take pictures of corporate information (say w=
hiteboards with writing). The lunch areas were also pretty open and guests =
would probably be able to eves drop on a conversation if they wanted to.=20

It makes it seem like that part of the security isn't regulated super tight=
ly. I wonder if it's a tradeoff between potential hazards and employee conv=
enience? </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">One of the big questions I have is on the d=
esigning of their own hardware. I understand that they claim custom designe=
d hardware provides better security because it is built for specific applic=
ations. My concern is though it seems to fall under a bit of "security thro=
ugh obscurity". Hardware that is only used in Google is not as widely teste=
d and Google is by no means an expert in hardware design. While it does red=
uce the number of attacks due to the fact that their hardware is less commo=
n (Meltdown and Spectre probably don't affect Google's machines), it also s=
eems that since the hardware is not as widely used there are likely to be m=
ore security holes.

I guess the question I have here is in practice, is following an agreed sta=
ndard or keeping a private implementation more secure for hardware, protoco=
ls, etc.?

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Paper Question

In the paper it mentions that Google uses Red Team exercises, how are these=
 penetration testing exercises usually conducted in industry?</pre></li>

A lot of esoteric terms are used in the report. The paper lacked overall st=
ructure. A comprehensive diagram of the safeguards at each level from Data =
Centers -&gt; Hardware -&gt; Software -&gt; Cloud would be immensely helpfu=
l. The paper only used specific terms such as application level encryption.=
 What is the application level, exactly, and what is above/below it? They a=

 difference between authentication and authorization? </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Question

Despite the scale of Google=E2=80=99s infrastructure and engineering organi=

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Question: how can Google detect DoS attacks=

can Google detect that a DDoS attack is taking place, since it is expected =
to be receiving hundreds of thousands of requests
from all over the globe at any given time? In that scenario, how would it b=
e able to discriminate between requests from the=20
attacker and normal requests (I imagine that the services are all operation=

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Questions for "Securing the Google Cloud Pl=
atform (GCP)":
"
Compute Engine enables customers to run their own virtual machines on Googl=
e=E2=80=99s infrastructure. The Compute Engine implementation consists of s=
everal logical components, most notably the management control plane and th=
e virtual machines themselves.
[...]
Each virtual machine (VM) runs with an associated virtual machine manager (=
VMM) service instance. The infrastructure provides these services with two =
identities. One identity is used by the VMM service instance for its own ca=
lls and one identity is used for calls that the VMM makes on behalf of the =
customer=E2=80=99s VM. This allows us to further segment the trust placed i=
n calls coming from the VMM."

These questions might not make sense but do Google customers get to customi=
ze the VMM service? How does having VMMs provide any additional security gu=
arantee?

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The "Deletion of Data" section stands out t=
o me as the one (main) area where Google decided to heavily place usability=
 before security.  That is, rather than securely deleting the data when ask=
ed, they instead hold onto it "just in case".  They also present this as a =
good thing and assure you that the data is still "deleted in accordance wit=
h service-specific policies."  Even deletion of an account appears to be ju=
st a series of deletion-scheduling messages being sent to the different ser=
vices.  The argument is that this protects users from unintentional data-de=
letion.  And it does.  However...

If services can describe their own deletion properties, what's stopping the=
m from just never deleting anything you ask them to?  Google apparently has=
 good data-at-rest policies, but this policy dictating deletion of user dat=
a seems to be designed with Google in mind more than with the customer in m=
ind.  I also wonder how much of the rest of Google's security infrastructur=
e is designed more towards facilitating their data-consumption needs than t=
owards consumers' data-privacy needs.  Everything in the article is spun in=
 a positive light- what else did they sneak in to their policy?  Perhaps mo=

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The document briefy mentions Google's effor=

ploits against Google? If so, this strategy seems totally inaccessible to a=

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The paper described lots of hardware-implem=
