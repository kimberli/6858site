<li><pre class=3D"student-text">	As far as which scheme is more user friend=
ly, it seems pretty clear that SMS is ahead in that sense. Most people will=
 always have their phone on them, so they do not have to carry anything add=
itional for 2FA with SMS, only their phone which is likely sitting in their=
 pocket. Users also don't particularly want to be thinking about security. =
So asking them to carry a USB dongle specifically for that reason is less o=
ptimal. With USB they'd also have to be checking if they are required to sh=
ow 'user presence' in which case they'd have to click the button on the don=
gle instead of entering the code that was sent to them via SMS and being lo=
gged in. Lastly, I think a big point is the fact that these days, we are lo=
gging into accounts on devices like phones and tablets that do not have USB=
 ports.

	As for which scheme is more secure, I would probably argue that the USB do=
ngle is better for that but I'm not entirely conviced. While I don't know m=
uch about SMS, I lean towards the USB dongle being more secure because with=
 that scheme, we know that everything is local on the hardware. The vulnera=
bilities lie with MITMs primarily, and other methods were the site requesti=
ng authentication is involved. So the easiest way to gain access would be t=
o physically retrieve the dongle, which would work great because the dongle=
 has no notion of a user. For the SMS scheme, there is more involved. Since=
 there is no real piece of hardware used for authentication, it is simply a=
 code sent via SMS. I imagine there could be a way to intercept said messag=
es and then they would have access. Of course, the attacker would have to b=
e quick as those codes usually don't have a very long life-span, and would =
also have to make sure they weren't used by the user already. At first I wa=
s thinking that SMS would be more secure, as it also shared the physical vu=
lnerability of the phone being obtained by an attacker, with the exception =
that most people use passwords on their phones. The extra passwords on the =
phone would give another small layer of protection, however, I began to thi=
nk that it might be possible to just remove the SIM card and place it in a =
phone that is unlocked, then request authentication so that the SMS code ca=
n be sent to a phone where it can be viewed. I'm not entirely sure if that =
is the way that works, however. So, I am leaning towards the idea that the =
USB dongle scheme would be more secure than SMS.

Lecture 3

Two-factor Authentication (2FA) is commonly used to authenticate users. For=
 example, MIT allows as a second factor a code sent via an SMS message to t=
he user's cell phone. The FIDO standard describes a 2FA scheme using a USB =
dongle. Which scheme is more secure? Which scheme is more user friendly?

I think the USB dongle is more secure since it doesnot interacts with any o=
ther system via the internet or telecom service. So it is much harder for a=
 malware to attack your dongle than your phone.=20
The SMS scheme is more user-friendly since almost everyone has a phone thes=
e days that they carry with themselves anyway whereas the dongle would be s=
omething they'll need to explicitly take care of and is easier to lose.</pr=
e></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I wouldn't say either is more secure than t=
he other. I think it would be equally easy for someone to sneak a peak at s=
omeone's phone or steal a USB dongle (I don't think people would pay *as* m=
uch attention to the dongle compared to their phone, so it'd be easier to s=
teal. However, sneaking a glance at a phone's lock screen isn't usually ver=
y hard...)

The cellphone scheme is a lot more user friendly. I would definitely not wa=
nt to carry a dongle around... I'd lose it :/
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">In my opinion, the SMS message version is m=
ore user friendly. I personally always have my phone on me and am used to c=
arrying around my phone whereas having to carry around a USB dongle would b=
e much less convenient and I am more likely to lose it or forget it. Howeve=
r, the USB dongle is more secure. This is because it requires a physical "t=
est of user presence" whereas a hacker could feasible hack into a cell phon=
e from afar. The bar for MITM attacks is also very high the case of the USB=
 dongle because the attacker would have to be able to get a cert for the ac=
tual origin name issues by a valid CA and the browser doesn't support Chann=
ellDs.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Lec 3 (User Authentication) Question: Which=
 scheme (2FA with SMS message code or with USB dongle) is more secure? Whic=
h is more user friendly?

The USB dongle 2FA seems more more secure than the MIT 2FA with SMS message=
 code for a variety of reasons. There is the check that the U2F device had =
issued the Key Handle before signing any message. Also, the U2F device has =
the benefit of physical isolation. Finally, the USB dongle has protection a=
gainst several MITM attacks which the paper discusses. I'm not sure what pr=
otections the SMS message code has, but it seems more susceptible to MITM a=
ttacks.

I think that the USB dongle is more user friendly in a lot of ways too. Sur=
e, it is a pain if the user loses their dongle, but the U2F dongles are des=
igned to work without setup on a computer, and can reduce the need for a co=
mplicated password, instead using a shorter PIN code.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Two-factor Authentication (2FA) is commonly=
 used to authenticate users. For example, MIT allows as a second factor a c=
ode sent via an SMS message to the user's cell phone. The FIDO standard des=
cribes a 2FA scheme using a USB dongle. Which scheme is more secure? Which =
scheme is more user friendly?

Using a code sent to SMS can definitely be more secure, especially if the p=
hone is equipped with more security features such as a pin that requires un=
locking. I=E2=80=99d argue the USB dongle is less secure because anyone can=
 just take it and use it on your laptop. However, the usb dongle is definit=
ely more user friendly because all you need to do is plug it in. For sms co=
des, you actually need to enter the code into the browser, which takes time=
 and effort.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Comparing the two schemes, the 2FA scheme u=
sing a USB dongle is by far more secure, whereas I would argue that the cel=
l phone SMS message is more user friendly.
Most students already have phones that can get SMS messages, so obtaining a=
nd maintaining a USB dongle would be additional work whereas using the SMS
messages would be hardly any different from what they are used to. However,=
 by being a message over the network, SMS can be vulnerable to adversaries
listening for the messages, whereas the USB dongle is directly physically c=
onnected to the machines needing to access the resources.=20

One side note regarding the security of the second factor scheme that MIT u=
ses, it is possible to access resources behind a two factor wall using one
device. By accessing the internet on your cell phone, and attempting to acc=
ess MIT resources, one can input the email and password associated with the=
ir
account and then request an SMS message to use the cell phone as the second=
 factor authentication. This bypasses 2FA completely and makes the SMS mess=
aging
scheme that much less secure than a USB dongle.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text"># Reading Assignment L3
# Rayden Y. Chia

Two-factor Authentication (2FA) is commonly used to authenticate users. For=
 example, MIT allows as a second factor a code sent via an SMS message to t=
he user's cell phone. The FIDO standard describes a 2FA scheme using a USB =
dongle. Which scheme is more secure? Which scheme is more user friendly?

Traditional OTP (using SMS) has limitations:
- Users need to type codes during their login process.
- Manufacturers often possess the seed value of the tokens.
- There is administrative overhead resulting from having to set up and prov=
ision devices for users.
- It requires the storage of secrets on servers, providing a single point o=
f attack.

The FIDO standard solves some of the abovementioned problems:
- The user never has to type a code, instead he just inserts the USB key an=
d touches a button.
- Enterprises can configure their own encryption secrets on a USB key, whic=
h means no one else ever sees those secrets.
- OTPs generated by a USB key are significantly longer than those requiring=
 user input (32 characters vs 6 or 8 characters) which translates to a high=
er level of security
- USB keys allow enrollment by the user, which reduces administrative overh=
ead.
- It is easy to implement with any existing website with no client software=
 needed.
- FIDO uniquely offers a token prefix that can be used for identity, simpli=
fying enrollment and user experience through the Open Authentication standa=
rd.

It is obvious then that in both cases, the FIDO standard using a USB dongle=
 is more secure and user-friendly. However, it requires the user to always =
carry his USB dongle with him, so the reduced risk is transferred from the =
server to the user.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">1. 2FA scheme using USB dongle is more secu=
re than SMS.
2. SMS is more user friendly because you don't need to care about extra dev=
ices.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">1. A username and password, along with some=
 form of local authentication (fingerprint, duo, ...) like the UAF protocol=
 described in the paper. The trade offs are that it will take users somewha=
t longer to log in, but it will stop someone who knows someone else's usern=
ame and password from logging in as them. It will also require users to kee=
p on them some form of additional authentication.

2. A username and password, plus some credentials on the user's laptop. Thi=
s will require the user to go through some additional steps anytime they ac=
cess their account from a new machine, but so long as those steps are also =
secure (could be some form of 2-factor authentication) then the device will=
 be trusted. This will limit the user's access to their account, and also s=
till leave them vulnerable if someone steals their laptop and their passwor=
d.

3. This would be a good use for a U2F authentication system because the net=
work will have no way of trusting the machine the user is on and the user w=
ill not necessarily be able to trust the network unless something like U2F =
is used. The tradeoff is that it requires the user to keep a physical devic=
e on them for access, which they could easily lose or forget and then be bl=
ocked out of accessing the site.

4. This would be a good use for the UAF protocol because the user is physic=
ally there and the ATM can be outfitted with the hardware to properly verif=
y the user's identity using both their credit card and another form of iden=
tifier. The tradeoff is that if the ATM hardware isn't reliable enough the =
user may be locked out and unable to withdraw money from their account.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">1. Password. Students often use Athena mach=
ines, and we might not expect them to carry around a U2F device all the tim=
e.

2. UAF protocol. Since it is a private laptop, it is unlikely for other peo=
ple to gain access to a user's laptop (for a prolonged period), and the aut=
hentication mechanism does not need to be as strong. An unauthorized user v=
iewing the bank balance also does not directly harm the user. Hence, we can=
 tradeoff authentication strength for convenience.

3. U2F protocol. A password might be risky since it is easy for a keylogger=
 to record the password, or for a hacker to obtain the password over the ne=
twork (if the connection is not https). UAF protocol is also inappropriate =
since another user can easily access the device once the user leaves, and w=
e want strong authentication.

4. U2F protocol. Withdrawing cash is an important operation and the user mu=
st be properly authenticated before allowing cash to be withdrawn. U2F prot=
ocol a strong authentication mechanism which makes it difficult for hackers=
 to withdraw cash of other users.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">2FA scheme using a USB dongle is more secur=

they use 2FA scheme with a USB dongle because it is more secure.
On the other hand, using a USB dongle is less user friendly for users as it=

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">6.858 Lecture
Kelvin Lu

Which one is more secure?

I have little information on how secure MIT's 2FA SMS system is, but I woul=
d assume
that it is less secure than the Dongle system presented, as users without D=
UO
will have potentially unencrypted SMS texts sent to their phones, which can=
 be
tapped by MITM attacks to get them. Other attacks MIT's 2FA system seems vu=
lnerable
to would be phones that spoof as the target user's phone, then getting the =
SMS
texts as well.

Which one is user friendly?

Probably MIT's 2FA system, as the dongle system requires that users have an=
other
device, whereas most people already own a phone.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">6.858 Lecture 3 Question - Collin Fijalkovi=
ch

While SMS is more user friendly, USB authentication is more secure. Users w=
ill tend to carry a mobile phone, but may not be inclined to carry another =
device.
their credit card information was used to gain control over their Verizon a=
ccount, which then allowed the attackers to transfer their
phone number. Although this was used for the purpose of verifying large cre=
dit card purchases, it could easily be used to subvert
the two factor authentication process.

Arguably there are scenarios where SMS is more secure. In cases where a mac=
hine is compromised, attackers may be able to compromise a USB device,
whereas they would only gain the one login access due to the separation of =
mobile device and machine. That said, SMS drastically increases
the possible routes of attack, and allows for social engineering which does=
 not involve user interaction.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">A 2FA scheme that utilizes a USB dongle ins=
tead of SMS messages is more secure. This is because there are more opportu=
nities for a hacker to get your SMS code, whether it be through phishing, m=
alware, or even SMS interception. For the USB dongle, there are still threa=
ts from malware, but not if the software is part of the OS itself instead o=
f being a user program, as outlined in the FIDO paper. There are even prote=
ctions put in place, using counters, to detect if a USB dongle has been clo=
ned in most cases. However, doing 2-factor authentification through SMS mes=
sages is much more user-friendly, because most people always have their cel=
lphone on them, but may not necessarily have a special USB dongle on them a=
t all times.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">A U2F device is more secure than Duo becaus=
e it is used only for one purpose and is a more simple system to analyze an=
d defend, while a phone is orders of magnitude more complex and not as many=
 guarantees can be made about its security.

However, Duo is more user-friendly because the user doesn't have to carry a=
nything new around. Most people always carry a phone and are used to instal=
ling utility apps.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">A USB dongle is more secure since it relies=
 on something physical people have as opposed
to access to an SMS sent to a phone number, which is vulnerable to a number=
 of security
problems like: the T Mobile incident where people could sign up for other p=
eople's phone
 numbers (and thus get their SMS messages without having the users physical=
 phone), people
 who share SMS messages across multiple devices with software (mirroring SM=
S messages to a
 laptop or service like PushBullet) will mean someone could obtain one of m=
any devices to
 authenticate SMS with.

However, I think it is conceivable that a password protected phone that doe=
sn't share
SMS in anyway and whose notifications are blocked without the password coul=
d be safer
than the USB dongle excluding any vulnerabilities in SMS traffic in general=
 that I'm not aware of.

The SMS messages are more convenient because users always will more easily =
bring their
phones everywhere than they will bring an extra USB dongle everywhere. Also=
, SMS sharing
services across devices can make it even more convenient for a User to get =
the SMS code
without even needing their phone.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">A USB dongle is more secure than SMS codes =
for several reasons: First,
SMS codes rely on the questionable security of the underlying phone
network.  Second, a smartphone on which a user installs random apps
and games is more likely to become compromised than a USB dongle used
solely for authentication.  Third, if a user is accustomed to
receiving SMS codes from many services, they can potentially be
tricked into providing codes to the wrong sites; an attacker can set
up a website where they ask users to enter an SMS code, and then
impersonate the user to another site and prompt that site to send the
user a code, which they enter into the evil site so the attacker can
enter it into the good site and gain access.

SMS codes are more user-friendly in that they don't require the user
to carry another piece of hardware, but less user-friendly in that
users may need to unlock their phones and check their texts to sign
in, rather than just plugging in a dongle and pressing a button.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">A USB dongle is more secure than an SMS mes=
sage because it is possible for there to be multiple ways to access SMS mes=
sages (such as me viewing my texts on my computer). Also, people might leav=
e their phone plugged in somewhere and you can often see the message on the=
 lock screen of the phone.

Although the text message is less secure, it is a lot more user friendly be=
cause people only have to remember their phones, which they are likely to a=
lready be carrying on them whereas requiring a person to have a USB dongle =
with them on top of their normal stuff would be more annoying for a user.</=
pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">A USB dongle is probably more secure since =
the only real way to compromise it is to physically get the device. However=
, it's also less user-friendly. People always have their phones on hand, ho=
wever carrying a USB device around is an additional effort which most users=
 probably don't want to make. </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">A verification code sent as an SMS message =
is convenient because most people with mobile phones carry them at all time=
s. However, insofar as this second factor is supposed to guarantee the user=
's identity by way of the presence of the mobile phone, an SMS code falls s=
hort. SMS messages are sent in cleartext and can be intercepted, or an atta=
cker can clone the carrier identifying information on a phone so that she r=
eceives the user's SMS messages. In contrast, the FIDO/U2F protocol makes c=
ryptographic guarantees that the second factor is physically present on the=
 client device. However, this comes with the inconvenient requirement that =
a user carries a special USB key at all times. Moreover, an attacker can st=
eal the USB key, gaining access to all the user's accounts while leaving th=
e user completely locked out.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Based on my reading, it seems that MIT's 2F=
A and FIDO's standard are very similar in terms of how security and user fr=
iendliness are provided. However, FIDO's standard requires a special U2F de=
vice (the USB). That might be an inconvenience, but it also certifies that =
the device doing the signature send to is safe. Therefore FIDO's version is=
 more secure but less user friendly.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Based on the different schemes described in=
 the paper, what do you think would be a reasonable choice for authenticati=
ng users in the following scenarios, and what trade-offs would you have to =
make:

1. Logging in to a public Athena machine in a cluster.
Username and password, perhaps some two-factor authentication like DUO. MIT=
 students are already set up with DUO so this change wouldn't be difficult =
for users to adapt to.

2. Checking your balance on a bank's web site via HTTPS from a private lapt=
op.
Username and password. A two-factor authentication device like the U2F woul=
d work well in this senario because it's convenient for the user leave thei=
r U2F device in their laptop, and so this method would provide additional s=
ecurity without additional hassle.

3. Accessing Facebook from an Internet cafe.
Internet cafes are pretty susceptible to MITM attacks, so there's a chance =
of your username and password getting stolen. However, unless Facebook requ=
ires additional security measures in every login scenario, I'm not sure how=
 added authentication at Internet cafes would help.

4. Withdrawing cash from an ATM.
Biometrics, such as fingerprint scanners or facial recognition, in addition=
 to the current debit card and pin would be a reasonable choice for authent=
icating users in this scenario. However, the ATM will have to store many us=
er's credentials because it's not a like a phone, which only has one owner.=
=20

</pre></li>

Question: Two-factor Authentication (2FA) is commonly used to authenticate =
users. For example, MIT allows as a second factor a code sent via an SMS me=
ssage to the user's cell phone. The FIDO standard describes a 2FA scheme us=
ing a USB dongle. Which scheme is more secure? Which scheme is more user fr=
iendly?

Answer:

The 2FA scheme described by the FIDO standard is more secure - the USB dong=
le created for this was meant to be used solely for this purpose. It featur=
es additional security features that a phone may not have, including protec=
tion against man in the middle attacks, proof of physical presence during r=
egistration, and "attestation" key-pairs for verifying a dongle's genuity.

The cell phone scheme is more user friendly, as it does not require a user =
to carry around an additional item with them that they otherwise would not =
have.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Given known vulnerabilities in the protocol=
 that carries SMS messages, an attacker can theoretically intercept them; t=
his makes SMS 2FA less secure than FIDO U2F. I would argue that FIDO with a=
 USB key is also more user-friendly because a user can simply put the key i=
n his computer when they want to authenticate, though one could say that pe=
ople are less likely to habitually use a FIDO USB key because it is one mor=
e thing to carry around, configure, and learn how to use for the first time=
.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I am inclined to think that the FIDO scheme=
 is more secure, since it is backed by hardware in addition to software, wh=
ereas it may be easier for someone to intercept a text message.

However, I think being able to get a text message is far more convenient to=
 the user than having to carry a USB device around, so users are more likel=
y to opt-in to the text message option.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I believe second factor authentication usin=
g SMS is safer than U2F protocol.
This is because if someone steals the usb, then they compromise all the acc=
ounts
attached with the usb as the usb has no way of knowing who is pressing the =
button.=20
But in the case of the phone, people can set up different types of security=
 such as=20
finger print on their phone so that even if their phone is stolen, someone =
can=EF=BF=BDt open it and see the messages.
But the U2F protocol can be safer if its authenticates its user before lett=
ing them press the button.=20
The U2F protocol is more user friendly as it serves a single keychain and m=
akes it easy to share passwords with others (i.e spouse).=20
Ultimately, the U2F protocol could also be embedded in phones.=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I believe that the 2FA scheme using the don=
gle is more secure. When using a cell phone you have to assume that the pho=
ne or phone number has not been compromised --- and that the message is act=
ually going to the right person. Additionally, texting the number and input=
ting it is not a physical process that has to happen, which was one of the =
key points of the "touch" part of the FIDO U2f device.


On the other hand, the code sent to the cell phone is more user friendly. T=
his way you don't run the risk of forgetting your USB dongle, or worse leav=
ing it in indefinitely and taking up one of your rare Mac USB ports.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I believe that the SMS system is more user-=
friendly and the U2F system appears more secure.

Right now, the SMS system seems more user-friendly because it doesn't add a=
nything new to the user's standard security procedures. Most users carry ar=
ound a phone, most users have good enough reception to always receive SMS m=
essages around a computer, and receiving SMS messages is a standard thing a=
t this point. On the other hand, the U2F is a whole new device that the use=
r would have to carry around. Users might forget it or lose it. The article=
 claims that losing a U2F device isn't a complete compromise of security bu=
t it does definitely impact availability, both through the user not being a=
ble to immediately activate, and having to obtain a new device and set it u=
p.=20

I could see the U2F becoming more user-friendly than the current system if =
it is incorporated into existing devices, as the plan appears to be. So, th=
e device would be inside a phone or computer and you could just press a but=
ton there to have the functionality. In this situation, the authentication =
would be faster than waiting for and entering and SMS message, and, as the =
article claims, would allow bfor shorter passwords than are currently the s=
tandard today.=20

As for security, I think that the U2F is more secure. The most glaring issu=
e with the SMS method is that SMS messages can be tapped into so a sophisti=
cated adversary could listen for those. Additionally, SMS message security =
depends on the security of the application that handles SMS messages in the=
 phone. If this application is compromised, these authentication messages a=
re compromised. In the U2F, the device isn't really smart, so we don't have=
 to trust it. I wonder if there would be issues with software U2F implement=
ations since we would have to place more trust on the signing authorities, =
and perhaps be more careful with the cloning issue.=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I believe the FIDO U2F standard is more sec=
ure than SMS. SMS 2FA can be subverted via social engineering at the career=
-side, and phone malware that may read users text messages. FIDO U2F has po=
tential other attack vectors, but they are harder to exploit. I believe for=
 frequent use FIDO U2F is more user friendly (a tap), but for less frequent=
 use SMS enables a basic level of 2FA without requiring the user to own usb=
 dongle or fear losing one.=20
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I find the SMS message more user friendly. =
Most people who have a computer already own a cell phone, so no additional =
hardware setup is required. I imagine that logging in would be faster with =
a USB device than waiting for and subsequently entering an SMS code, but si=
nce the difference is only a few seconds, I don't think it would be enough =
to merit acquiring a USB device and keeping it either plugged into one's co=
mputer at all times or at least nearby (and if it isn't already plugged in,=
 then the login process will probably be even slower overall). However, I c=
ould imagine that if every website that I needed to log in to required some=
 form of 2FA, then using a USB device might become more convenient.

I'm not sure which method is more secure. A USB dongle might be easier to s=
teal than a phone, and it might take longer before the user noticed it was =
missing. Additionally, a phone usually has some further locking mechanism (=
e.g. a PIN or swipe pattern) which is needed to unlock it; a USB dongle pro=
bably lacks this. I would thus expect that a phone might be more secure if =
the main threat is theft and subsequent use of the physical device. I think=
 there are also things that a USB device would do better than a phone; one =
example is that your phone is uniquely identified by your phone number, to =
which the SMS is sent. Thus multiple services that you access using SMS for=
 2FA can identify you as the same user; this isn't possible with the unique=
 keypair system described in the FIDO document.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I think U2F is probably more secure. A text=
 message could possibly be intercepted, while U2F might also require a fing=
erprint.

U2F is probably also more user friendly by a bit, it's easier to just press=
 a button than to check your text messages.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I think that 2FA using a USB dongle is more=
 secure than 2FA using SMS messages because an SMS message could be interce=
pted if an attacker got access to your phone number. Using the physical USB=
 dongle that requires the user to activate the device ensures that only the=
 user is asking for authentication. The 2FA with SMS messages is more user =
friendly because users usually have their phones at hand. This scheme doesn=
't require users to purchase a USB dongle and to carry it around whenever t=
hey want to access certain browser apps.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I think that 2FA with a USB dongle is both =
more secure and more user friendly.
An sms code could be intercepted while it's being sent, read by an app on y=
our phone, or you could be phished to enter it into a fake site. It could t=
hen be entered by an attacker to log in as you. These are all basically man=
 in the middle attacks, and the U2F scheme mostly protects against them.
It is also more user friendly because it is very fast and intuitive. Copyin=
g a code from in a text message onto a website is slow and allows for typos=
. Simply tapping on a usb dongle that you keep with you (or even keep perma=
nently in your computer) is much simpler.
For the MIT 2FA, I think the Duo app is the most user friendly of the avail=
able options because it's similarly fast to tap approve on a notification. =
However, I don't know how it works internally, so I can't say if it's more =
secure than U2F (I would guess that it's not).</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I think that the FIDO standard is more secu=
re, but the MIT 2FA scheme might be more userfriendly.
The MIT user can be compromised in many ways, for example: 1) An attacker s=
teal the MIT student's phone. 2) Text messages show up on the lock screen. =
3) Attackers can pretend to be the user to the cell phone service company a=
nd switch numbers (I think this has happened before)

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I think the 2FA USB dongle scheme is more s=
ecure since you have a dongle
that is solely used for the purposes of authentication, with way fewer
additional exploit channels than a phone may have. For example, if your=20
phone is running some sort of software with a vulnerability, then an=20
attacker could potentially create an exploit to bypass the 2FA.=20

However, I would say that the cell phone 2FA scheme is more user-friendly,
since these days most people carry a phone with them constantly and this sc=
heme
does not require users to carry anything more.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I think the FIDO standard is more secure be=
cause there are fewer avenues of attack. An attacker has more ways to compr=
omise a device when the device is used for multiple purposes. Because the U=
2F would exist on a flash drive for only that specific purpose, making sure=
 the U2F is untampered with is an easier problem.

On the other hand, MIT=EF=BF=BDs use of cellphones for the 2nd authenticati=
on factor is more user friendly as most people already have their phone wit=
h them at all times, so they do not need to keep track of another device.

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I would argue that sending an SMS to the us=
er is more secure - a USB dongle can be stolen easily. There are ways to in=
tercept SMS messages as well, but they are more technologically advanced th=
an simply stealing a U2F device. I would also argue that sending an SMS is =
more user-friendly, especially in a time where people are attached to their=
 phones. Carrying around another device solely for 2FA seems like an unreal=
istic expectation.

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">I'll say the scheme with the USB dongle is =
more secure. It may be possible to obtain someone's text messages without t=
heir permission, since they go through a third-party (a phone company), but=
 the 2FA scheme relies on keys that are exchanged directly between machine =
and USB device.

The text message scheme is slightly more user-friendly, since it doesn't re=
quire a user to buy a separate device and utlizes a device that the user wi=
ll use for other activities anyways -- such as talking or browsing the web.=
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">In my view, each scheme has its advantages =
and disadvantages when it comes to security and user friendliness.

The SMS message could be seen as more secure than the USB dongle which seem=
s to require a simple button press. If the USB dongle was physically compro=
mised, an attacker could simply press the button to generate the security c=
redentials, whereas a phone may require a passcode, facial recognition, or =
other security feature to access. At the same time, it would be easier for =
an attacker to compromise a mobile phone and access its content remotely th=
an the USB dongle.

As far as user friendliness goes, I dislike the idea of needing to carry ar=
ound a USB dongle with me everywhere I go. The active part of the device, h=
owever, is more user-friendly, as a button press is easier than unlocking m=
y phone and typing in the 6- to 8-digit code I'm expected to remember.</pre=
></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">It is possible to receive and send messages=
 from one phone as if it were from another, so perhaps using a certified us=
b dongle is more secure. However, most people already have cell phones, so =
it is more of a bother to have to acquire a usb dongle. That being said, it=
 seems that once you have a usb dongle it is easier to just tap that than t=
o have to receive, read, and relay an SMS message.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Jun Wan 991032935

I think the FIDO scheme is more secure. The adversary might still break int=
o a MIT account without access to the user's phone. After all, the second-f=
actor password is a six digit number and might be guessed after a hundred t=
housand trials. However, it is impossible to pass a U2F authentication with=
out the U2F token.

In terms of convenience, both scheme has their own advantages. MIT's scheme=
 use your phone as the second-factor device so that users don't have to car=
ry a token. For the U2F scheme, user only need to remember a four digit pas=
sword. Personally, I think MIT's scheme is more user-friendly. It is easy t=
o remember a password, but carrying a USB device all the time can be troubl=
esome.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Lec3

The scheme proposed by FIDO is more secure because the U2F
device has a concept of origin.  The U2F device also needs
to be activated (via a button) and would be used specifically
for security purposes.  A phone, in contrast, is not origin
specific and easier to spoof.

The phone is a more user-friendly scheme as most people own
a cell phone and thus do not need to purchase anything
additional.  The cell phone is also not origin specific,
and can be used to authenticate wherever.</pre></li>

As they describe in the paper, the USB scheme is more secure - since bypass=

means getting access to the content in the USB, which implies some sort of =
physical=20

Two-factor Authentication (2FA) is commonly used to authenticate users.
For example, MIT allows as a second factor a code sent via an SMS message
to the user's cell phone. The FIDO standard describes a 2FA scheme using
a USB dongle. Which scheme is more secure? Which scheme is more user friend=
ly?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
--

As for security, I can say that the SMS message is the less secure method. =
At
one point I was using a service where I could basically read my texts on my
laptop. Whenever I hit one of MIT's 2FA walls, the code would just pop up a=
s a
text message on the same device. Although, this method is more user friendl=
y. A
user (especially my age) is very likely to have their phone (or a device ge=
tting
SMS messages) on their person at any given time.

The U2F method has many additional perks that the SMS method does not. In
addition to a stronger password, U2F also gives you better protection again=
st
MITM attacks since the keys hash the origin as well. The device itself uses
public/private keys and uses cryptographically secure keys which can not be
brute forced. In fact, the U2F keys also use a 4-digit pin or could possibl=
y be
build to use other data such as biometrics to add another layer of security=
 on
top of a classical physical key.

However, introducing a new software system into the mix opens the
possibility of new bugs. The paper touches on a few types of attacks malwar=
e on
a user's machine could execute.

In terms of the UX of the U2F key, I think there is something to be said of
physical keys. Physical keys have a much better track record throughout hum=
an
history than user generated passwords do in their short history. While ther=
e is
definitely a huge bootstrapping issue in getting enough keys out in the wor=
ld,
the cost of such devices should be small. While physical keys also have sec=
urity
pitfalls, I believe they are easier and more intuitive to reason about.

Since currently very few internet users have U2F keys, the SMS 2FA is defin=
itely
the more user friendly and easily bootstrappable option. Although, this opt=
ion
is not the most secure option, it still has increased security compared to
a  regular user-supplied password system without a 2nd factor.

---------

It's hard for me to say with is secure.  Without knowing a lot about phone =
security, I want to say it's less secure.  Phone numbers can change, be los=
t or acquired by new people, and thus they would receive the message.  Also=
, people often leave their cell phones unsecured, and in the modern age, th=
e phone could be both the accessing device (using a browsing app) and the s=
econd form of authentication.  That being said, users can at least lock the=
ir phones, but the dongle has no such option, and so once it is acquired th=
ere are no additonal barriers to having the second factor.

For many people, the phone will seem more user friendly, as they usually ha=
ve it on them anyways to do many other tasks throughout the day.  On the ot=
her hand, while rare, there may be situations where you're on a machine tha=
t has network but you have no cell signal or wifi to get the second factor =
through.  Personally, my phone sucks, so I've found the yubikey (also usabl=

Question:

 example, MIT allows as a second factor a code sent via an SMS message to t=
he user's cell phone. The FIDO standard describes a 2FA scheme using a USB =
dongle. Which scheme is more secure? Which scheme is more user friendly?

Answer:
The UTF standard is more secure because the USB dongle and the origin servi=
ce participate in the authentication process. With 2FA, only the origin ser=
vice participates in the authentication processs. 2FA is simply another ver=
ification step where data is sent to the origin service. No device on the c=
lient side participates in the authentication process. The client just send=
s data to the service.

For example, 2FA has no way of detecting clones because the 2FA client has =
no way of keeping track of how many times it has interacted with the origin=
 service. This is because the 2FA client doesn't interact with the origin s=
ervice directly.

Although the U2F scheme is more secure, I think 2FA is more user friendly b=

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Lecture 3 - Ajinkya Nene

The USB dongle scheme is more secure as it is hardware-backed rather than s=
oftware-backed. This makes a hack more unlikely to occur. Yet, the SMS vers=
ion is more user-friendly since it allows for seamless 2FA usage, many peop=
le have SMS notifications integrated into their computers. Thus, the usage =

g Question

Security - I believe that technically, both systems seem comparable, so to =
differentiate the systems I would like to evaluate
each one in practice. MIT's cellphone approach lets anyone with access to a=
 user's cellphone login to their account once they
figure out the user's password. The USB device is similar, but has the adde=
d benefit of also requiring the device used to belong
to the same user, which gives it an advantage over MIT's cellphone approach=
. With all of this considered, I would say that
the USB system has better security.

User Friendly - In terms of user friendly-ness, MIT's cellphone approach is=
 good because it makes use of a device that most
people already have, are familiar with, and will always carry around. In ad=
dition, a cellphone has many other purposes, meaning
that the burden of carrying around this device is alleviated because it has=
 use outside of this singular situation. The USB
approach requires people to carry around a smaller device that is more easi=
ly lost and has no added value outside of login
situations. In addition, although simple, the USB interface is new and so w=
ould require user adoption and adaption, acting as
at least another small barrier to entry. Both approaches can be achieved wi=
th a handful of clicks from each device, making
them comparable in terms of physical effort. With all of this considered, I=
 would say that MIT's cellphone approach is more user

Lecture 3 Question
Two-factor Authentication (2FA) is commonly used to authenticate users. For=
 example, MIT allows as a second factor a code sent via an SMS message to t=
he user's cell phone. The FIDO standard describes a 2FA scheme using a USB =
dongle. Which scheme is more secure? Which scheme is more user friendly?
The USB dongle is the more secure scheme than a second factor code sent via=
 SMS message.  The SMS message can be intercepted, either through SIM card =
hijacking or faking cell phone towers that intercept text messages.  Furthe=
r, a phone number change can be spoofed, making it appear that the user cha=
nged networks, allowing for texts to one number to be intercepted.  In the =
case of the USB Dongle, this generally involves having physical access to t=
he dongle and cannot be done remotely.
I think the question of being more user friendly somewhat depends on the us=
er.  On the one hand, if most of the authentication is being done on a lapt=
op/desktop computer, then having the USB dongle can be more user friendly. =
 This simply, then, requires pressing a button on the dongle instead of nee=
ding to pull up a new device or have another device on hand to complete the=
 login.  If a phone is dead, for example, then making use of an SMS Message=
 or the DUO app won=EF=BF=BDt work; further, this can lock a user out of th=
eir account.  On the other hand, when a web app being run of a mobile devic=
e requires authentication, then using a mobile device if more user friendly=
 (especially when it involves making actions on a push notification).  Assu=
ming that most actions that require authentication are originating from an =
app run a desktop/laptop, the use of a USB dongle is more user-friendly.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Not sure which one is more secure...perhaps=
 the SMS messaging is more secure since someone would have to physically st=
eal your phone to obtain the texted code. Sim cards and phones are easily d=
isabled though the service provider. When using a USB dongle, it is possibl=

The FIDO standard is more secure since it relies on a secure enclave to sto=

at the device. Whereas SMS messages have many issues, as an example the use=

Which off the two methods is more user-friendly is up to personal taste. I =

 SMS to be delivered,
but for other users it could be an issue. Also problematic is 2FA if the ph=

FIDO is more secure because in both cases you require a username and passwo=
rd. However, in the case where a phone or USB gets lost, someone else can u=
se the phone but not the USB. Usually phones will display texts sent to it,=
 and thus you may see the code. If someone has the USB, they are not able t=
o use it with their device because of a mismatched origin. Furthermore, hav=
ing the USB would not give any indication of who's it belongs to as opposed=
 to a phone which is very easy to easy whos it belongs to.=20

In terms of user friendliness, the initial process of FIDO standard might b=
e difficult in the sense that it is not as obvious to initially set up. Hav=
ing an SMS text is relatively easier to implement and understand as people =
are constantly using their phones. On the other hand using the USB dongle i=

Answer:

I would think that the FIDO scheme is more secure because the USB is an iso=

's identity. The cell phone scheme seems less secure because cell phones ha=
ve many processes running on them, thus it is more likely that malicious so=

 more value than USB. This means that cell phones are more likely to be sto=

reduction in accessibility for a duration of time.

In terms of user friendliness, both schemes seem to be fairly easy to use. =

The second factor identification with text is easier because there is no=20

of login codes.

The 2FA scheme is more secure because it uses a hash of the origin and=20
public-private key encryption to verify communication and approvals. The
text messages, however, could be intercepted or spoofed by a MITM.</pre></l=
i>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">SMS-based 2FA approaches are less secure th=
an dedicated hardware (e.g. USB dongles). Since text messages are sent over=
 a cell network, if a phone connects to a fake cell tower, the message can =
be intercepted; USB dongles more adequately test the condition of "somethin=
g you have". However, phone-based 2FA is more user friendly, since users ar=
e more likely to have their cell phones on them when logging in.

Dedicated mobile apps like Google Authenticator or Duo are more secure than=
 SMS and come with the usability benefit of being available on your mobile =
phone.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Sending a second factor code via SMS allows=
 for various attacks. You can attempt to break the encrpytion used by GSM a=
nd intercept the message. Someone within the network operator also has the =
potential to intercept the message. Furthermore, it is very easy to make ap=
ps that read SMS messages and it is possible that a malicious app could be =
forwarding your two factor authentication codes to an attacker. In contrast=
 the USB dongle keeps its secret in hardware and does not need to transmit =
this secret over the network. This makes it more secure as it requires a ph=
ysical (and therefore higher cost) attack to break this form of authenticat=
ion.

However, this scheme is much less user friendly. If a user forgets her devi=
ce at home, then she will not be able to log in to any of her accounts. Fur=
thermore, if she loses her device entirely she will need to recover her acc=
ount in other ways. If these recovery mechanisms are less secure then the a=
dditional security gained by using a usb dongle is lost. In contrast most u=
sers are less likely to leave their phone at home and if they lose their ph=
one they can buy a new phone and set it up with their cell carrier.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The 2FA scheme that sends a text message is=
 more user friendly because this
enables users to login to their accounts on their mobile devices, whereas m=
ost
phones don't support direct USB connection.
However, the USB dongle is more secure because if a phone has been stolen a=
nd
hacked, the 2FA is essentially useless since the phone login and 2FA are on=
 the
same device. This pitfall also applies to people who keep the USB dongle
attached to their laptops though. If they lose the laptop with the dongle
attached, the 2FA is also useless.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The 2FA scheme using a USB dongle is both m=
ore secure and more user friendly. One example for security, especially wit=
h respect to privacy, is that this scheme does not have a global identifier=
 for a particular online service or website. Thus, if someone loses the USB=
, the person who finds it cannot gain any useful information from it (like =
which accounts it was used for). On the other hand, with the MIT scheme, if=
 you lose your phone, chances are you have not deleted those SMS messages, =
and they may give away information about the origin (the service/website) b=
y the number of even in a statement (I=E2=80=99ve received messages like =
=E2=80=9CYour Google verification code is =E2=80=94-=E2=80=9C).

On the user friendly side, it is really easy to keep a USB dongle in your l=
aptop and use it as necessary, compared to having to check your phone each =
time you want to log in. There is an argument that this convenience makes t=
he USB dongle scheme less secure, because anyone can just tap the USB insid=
e your laptop, and a phone is a completely separate device so you would nee=
d access to the two together. However, I would argue that it would be harde=
r to get into the laptop anyway than the phone, and you could also be tryin=
g to use the online service on your phone anyway (in which case that is als=
o just one device).</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The 2FA scheme using a USB dongle is more s=

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The 2FA scheme using a USB dongle is more s=

 be as easy to verify with, for instance, a 3rd party app. On the other han=
d, an SMS code sent to a users cell phone is more user friendly, since the =
user does not need to start carrying around an additional device.



</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The 2FA scheme which uses a USB dongle is m=
ore secure. In the 2FA scheme where an SMS message is sent to the user's ce=
ll phone, there are several more layers where an attacker could compromise =
the security of the login process. For example, because the SMS message is =
sent over a network, any security issues relevant to the network become rel=
evant to the login process.=20

However, the cell phone SMS scheme is certainly more user-friendly. This do=
es not require a user to remember to carry an additional single-purpose dev=

/pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The 2FA scheme with a USB dongle is more se=
cure than the second factor via SMS message. This is because of extra preca=
utions with the U2F section, e.g. man in the middle protection: the user's =
U2F device does not even respond when a man-in-the-middle tries to interfer=
e with authentication, whereas the 2FA scheme with SMS does not have such p=
rotections. However, the SMS scheme is certainly more user-friendly because=
 most people carry around their phones with them on a regular basis, wherea=
s the other scheme requires people to carry around an extra form of authent=
ication.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The 2FA scheme with a USB dongle is undoubt=
edly more secure. Communications between the USB dongle and the online serv=
er are secured with public/private keys, making tampering impossible withou=
t it being detectable. Cell phone text communications have been intercepted=
 before; it's possible for an adversary to spoof the cell phone and receive=
 messages w/ the 2FA code. Meanwhile, MITM attacks on USB dongle are much m=
ore difficult to implement, since the USB system offers several protections=
.=20

The cell phone scheme, however, is a lot more user friendly. Both 2FA schem=
es require the user carry the device around in order to log in. A user is l=
ikely to have his phone, but not necessarily the dongle everywhere. In addi=
tion, usage of U2F requires numerous Javascript interactions built into the=
 browser or the mobile device.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The FIDO 2FA scheme with the USB dongle is =
more secure, as it requires possessing the physical USB device in order to =
authenticate the user. It would be infeasible for an attacker to acquire ma=
ny people's physical USB devices. I think that 2FA with an SMS message, how=
ever, is more user friendly because most people carry their phones with the=
m so they don't need to continually carry the USB. Users can also use an ac=
count on multiple devices at the same time without the need of multiple USB=
 devices. </pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The FIDO USB authentication scheme is more =
secure than the SMS message scheme, as it is more resistant to man-in-the-m=
iddle attacks. For example, an adversary may be able to remotely intercept =
SMS messages sent to the user's phone, and read the messages to impersonate=
 the user (assuming the adversary knows the user's password). The U2F proto=
col sends origin names and signatures to distinguish the user, origin, and =
a man-in-the-middle, so the U2F scheme is more secure in this respect.

The two schemes seem similarly user-friendly, as both require the user to p=
erform a simple task as a second factor.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The FIDO USB dongle scheme is more secure. =
Many phones have minimal unlock security, or display SMS notifications that=
 can be viewed without unlocking the phone. Some users may receive SMS mess=
ages through Facebook, Whatsapp, or Google Voice, which are online accounts=
 themselves and can be compromised. The verification code is sent over the =
network, which relies on many third parties to prevent eavesdropping. In co=
mparison, the FIDO U2F standard's verification is not easily human readable=
 or spoofable, especially compared to a 6 digit number. No information is s=
ent over the network except when registering the key. The computation is do=
ne on an isolated USB key, not on the user's computer (or phone) which is m=
ore easily compromised.

The SMS scheme is likely more friendly for a greater range of people, but t=
he USB key has some advantages: If attached to a keychain/wallet, it's more=
 likely to stay on you than a phone. The USB key won't run out of battery. =
It's easier to carry around. It doesn't rely on cellular signal.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The FIDO scheme is more secure because it a=

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The FIDO standard with the physical USB is =

tacks like the Duo system is.

I think the user friendliness could be debated, and there are pros and cons=
 to both. Duo doesn't require users to carry an additional physical device =
because almost everyone already carries around a smart phone. However, Duo =
does require the step for a user to type in a code that they receive via SM=
S. I think the USB dongle is probably slightly more user friendly than Duo.=
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The MIT scheme is more user-friendly and co=

o get the authentication as a DUO Push, a pin that=E2=80=99s preset and loa=
ded in DUO, or a phone call. You get to pick every time how you want to aut=
henticate. If you choose phone call and you=E2=80=99re an Apple user where =
your macbook and iphone are linked, you can receive the authentication phon=

someone stole my laptop and they had my password, they=E2=80=99d be able to=
 easily log in if they chose the phone all option, 2FA scheme being practic=

In most cases, the SMS solution is more user friendly. It doesn=E2=80=99t r=

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">The U2F scheme is more secure, as SMS-based=
 2FA has several potential security holes through telecom companies. It is =

The SMS message is probably more user friendly because the user (presumably=

Which is more user friendly is dependent on the actual process to register =
this U2F device. For instance, it depends on the nature of the javascript p=

is more user friendly.

However, I think the text message system is less secure because it involves=
 the SIM card

FIDO's standard is more secure. FIDO describes two ways the authentication =
can be performed, either in hardware or software. Hardware authentication w=
ould be more secure than cell phone authentication. For example, onlookers =
could peek over the user's shoulder and see the codes even on the lock scre=
en of the phone. Overcoming the hardware security would require stealing th=
e user's USB dongle, a significantly more difficult task. In essence, there=
 is no way to peek and see the authentication for a hardware device, but th=
ere is for phone verification. FIDO may also be authenticated with software=
. Software authentication, in worst case, may be comparably as secure as SM=
S, but no less secure than SMS. For instance, a software authentication sch=
eme that displays the auth codes for a user to type would be just as insecu=
re as SMS. A software authenitcation scheme that performs authorization at =
a level unseen by humans would be more secure.=20

scheme is more user friendly?

The first article we had to read for this lecture introduces the idea that =
"more secure" is a somewhat more subjective designation than might be immed=
iately apparent.  For instance, a longer, more complicated password that ch=
anges every day is clearly more "more secure" in terms of entropy then a sh=
ort easy-to-remember one, but carries with it the inherent risk of being un=
usable.  Thus, the easier, less traditionally-secure password may actually =
be "more secure"; again, depending on the circumstances around its use.

Therefore, when comparing the above 2FA schemes, one must also use some cau=
tion to avoid falling into incorrect absolutes.  Having a standalone device=
, as described in the FIDO standard, seems like the "more secure" choice in=
 that it fully decouples your 2FA from everything else.  The SMS to a cellp=
hone method could fall due to a malicious actor gaining access to the cellp=
hone through a browser exploit, an untrusted side-loaded app, a bug in the =
underlying phone infrastructure, or even telcom interference.  The proposed=
 dongle, on the other hand, has a singular focus and thus only a (roughly) =
singular attack surface. =20

However, much like the lengthy oft-changing password schemes, having to car=
ry around an entirely new device that is required to gain access to your pe=
rsonal accounts may present some unexpected usability issues.  It's much ea=
sier to remember to bring your phone everywhere than your phone *and* this =
other 2FA device, which may cause users to simply choose to opt-out of 2FA =
altogether. =20

Balancing security and usability is a very delicate game due to how intertw=
ined these two tenants are.  Providing options to the end-user which allows=
 them to cater their risk vs. convenience seems like a logical choice to en=
sure that even if a user opts out of the "most secure" option, they still h=
ave the ability to enjoy the benefits of 2FA to some degree.</pre></li>

The SMS authentication scheme prooved to be vulnerable and insecure. In Jul=
y 2016, America's National Institute for Standards and Technology has advis=
ed abandonment of SMS-based two-factor authentication. Down in section 5.1.=
3.2 of https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html, the document says ou=
t-of-band verification using SMS is deprecated and won't appear in future r=
eleases of NIST's guidance. There's a certain history of successful attacks=
 which exploited flaws in the cell networks, which lays behind that decisio=
n. There's a good article here https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/18/16328172/=
sms-two-factor-authentication-hack-password-bitcoin.

The security of the scheme which uses a USB dongle is more secure than the =
SMS authentication scheme, because it allows to quickly recognize if an aut=
hentication token is compromised, e.g. lost or stolen, thus limit a time wi=
ndow available for an attacker. Second, it's very close to impossible to "s=
teal" a key inside a FIDO U2F Security Key and it makes its security better=
 too. Finally, a USB key is used for secure authenticaion all the time, whi=
le an SMS authentication is commonly used only in cases of the elevated ris=
k of compromisation or sensitive transactions. E.g. MIT doesn't require a 2=
FA in case I'm using a certificate installed on my machine. Also, we all re=
member the scene from Mr. Robot when a phone was temporary stolen to get an=
 access to an SMS message. Although, it'd be fair to say that the USB dongl=
e authentication scheme could have been compromized through a human factor =
too. Building up on the human factor, we need to take into account that peo=
ple tend to keep things simple and can forget to unplug a dongle from a com=
puter as much as they constantly forget to lock it.   =20

The usability of both of the methods has its pros and cons. The SMS method =
can be perceived as more intuitive, because it's associated with a routine =
process of receiving an SMS on a phone which is always with us, thanks to t=
he messengers &amp; social networks. However, the manual entry of a code fr=
om an SMS message creates frictions in the experience of users. On the othe=
r hand, a USB dongle is one more device we'd need to keep with us, remember=
 to unplug when we leave a workplace, and avoid loosing it, and it's hard.

In summary, I'd vote for the FIDO U2F Security Key, because it provides a h=
igher level of protection with a better user experience, which is actually =
increasing more the key is used.</pre></li>

Which is more secure?
The FIDO USB dongle gets this one in my book. It does not store any user in=
formation. Getting access to the device does not tell the attacker *which* =
websites it could attack. The attacker will also need information about the=
 user's username and password. For the SMS, if the attacker has access to t=
he user's phone (probably a smartphone) and has gained access it, they will=
 easily be able to get information about the user and probably be able to u=
se the saved passwords in their phone to gain access to all of their accoun=
ts.

Which is more user friendly?
This is actually a tie for me. For the FIDO scheme, you can have devices pe=
rmanently attached to your device, which means that you don't have to searc=
h for your phone everytime you need to log in. On the other hand, it is har=
d to connect it to your phone vs your laptop (although if it gets non-USB t=
ransports in the future, this will not be an issue). It is also easy to for=
get, whereas people now-a-days would always have their phone on them.=20

ich scheme is more user friendly?

User-friendliness
-----------------
The user-friendliness is straightforward: the majority of Americans already=
 own a smartphone, while (since the standard is still in an early stage), v=
irtually no Americans own a U2F-compatible peripheral. Therefore, an SMS-ba=
sed 2FA strategy is more user-friendly.

Security
--------
The security of each scheme is dependent on the possibility/probability of =
physical access to the 2FA device. In both cases, we'll assume the attacker=
 already has the user's username and password.

Physical access improbable/impossible: the U2F peripheral would only be acc=
essible if the host device had been remotely compromised (precluding any at=
tempt at security), while SMS-based authentications can be MITMed. The U2F =
MITM attack requires much more sophistication than an SMS MITM, so in this =
case the U2F peripheral appears more secure.

Physical access possible/probable: this scenarios is pretty comparable. On =
the one hand, an open, unlocked host device is easily taken advantage of wi=
th a freely-exposed U2F peripheral. However, many smartphone users allow th=
eir text messages to be viewed without unlocking their phone, allowing an e=
qually trivial attack vector.

Thus, given that the remote attack is the more prevalent attack, we'll say =
it seems the U2F-based 2FA is more secure than the SMS-based 2FA.
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">U2F tokens are more secure against many kin=

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">USB dongle vs. SMS message 2FA

Security:
Both schemes require the use of a physical device for authentication.
The USB dongle requires a test of physical presence since the user needs
to press a button to complete the authentication process. The attacker woul=
d
need to have physical possession of the device.

If an attacker somehow has remote access to a user's SMS messages, the atta=
cker
would not need to have physical possession of the user's cell phone.
In case the attacker did physically possess either device, cell phones typi=
cally
have finger-print scanners and passcode requirements which a USB dongle wou=
ld not have
(although on most phones you do not need to unlock the screen in order to s=
ee a recent, unread text message).

I would also guess that 5 or 6-digit codes are not as secure as key pairs a=
nd signatures.

I think it's probably easier to lose the USB dongle than a phone, but overa=
ll I would say
that it is more secure.

User Friendliness:
The USB dongle is easier to use since it consists of clicking through a=20
pop-up window or two and pressing a single button. The user would only need
to take one hand off the keyboard and only very briefly.
With the SMS method you need to wait for the message to arrive (which, comp=

in accordance with the FIDO U2F protocol, could provide strong authenticati=

 can increase security vulnerabilities, e.g. SMS codes can be more easily i=

 a hassle. USB type and FIDO U2F protocol compatibility problems with host =
devices could also become troublesome.</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">When evaluating these two options (SMS vs. =
USB dongle), we really have to depend on the context.

SECURITY
USB dongle appears more secure because the SMS system depends on the securi=
ty of the SMS network, the phone that receives it (which is not as controll=
ed of an ecosystem as the dongle), and the user to type something manually.=
 However, as we saw in the FTC blog post on mandatory password changes, sec=
urity can actually decrease from a "more secure system" that simply isn't u=
ser friendly. The SMS system is much more accessible to people, so they are=
 probably much more likely to use it than a dongle they have to carry aroun=
d everywhere.

USER FRIENDLY
Here, the SMS system seems more user friendly (at least for SMS-savvy users=
) because it leverages a user interface that many people are already famili=
ar with. However, the USB dongle could be seen as user-friendly because it =
"requires less button presses" typically. Additionally, it could lead to le=
ss frustration in the event that the user's phone dies (except it is much m=
ore susceptible to being left at home than a phone).
</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Whether an SMS message or a USB dongle is m=
ore secure depends on the threat model. The SMS approach can be compromised=
 if the phone is compromised, which can happen remotely, whereas compromisi=
ng the USB would require either physically stealing it or eavesdropping dur=
ing the secret-exchange phase. FIDO-standard TFA calls for a password as si=
mple as a 4-digit PIN, leaving very little between the system and an attack=

</pre></li>

<li><pre class=3D"student-text">Why scheme is more secure?
Overall, I think that FIDO's 2FA system is more secure.

I don't know how easy it is to spoof a cellphone number. However, it seems =
difficult to spoof the USB dongle due to encryption and counters.

Additionally, the USB dongle is relatively safe from MITM attacks. Instead =
of having two distinct channels to perform the MITM attack on, the adversar=
y only has one for any origin. Additionally, detection of a MITM attack ove=
r this channel is detectable in most *reasonable) scenarios (if the adversa=
ry has access to the website certificate for the website, the website itsel=
f has been compromised).

Both are vulnerable to malicious code on an either a computer or phone. If =
a system call for this USB dongle could be created and supported for all co=
mmon OSes, this would allow for the dongle to be more secure. However, as o=
f now, the playing field is even.

Due to lack of information on how secure SMS is, it is hard to say which sy=
stem is more secure. However, currently, I would say that FIDO's solution s=
eems to have the upper hand.

Which scheme is more user friendly?
2FA with a phone is more convenient for the user and probably easier to use=
 (less difficult to set up and change).

Computer Security Lecture 3

It is really hard to say whether the MIT 2FA scheme or the one described in=
 FIDO is more secure. There are many factors to think about in regard to th=
is question, but in the end I think the FIDO scheme is more secure. The fir=
st thought I had in regards to the security of both schemes is what happens=
 when you loose the 2FA device in both cases. With the MIT scheme this devi=
ce is your phone and in the FIDO case it is the USB device. In the FIDO cas=
e you don't really lose much when you lose the device. The paper describes =
how the device isn't globally identifiable with any particular website. If =
a random person finds the U2F device there isn't much they can do with it, =
where as a phone may be a different story.=20

It seems that the 2FA scheme that MIT has is more user friendly simply beca=
use most people already have smart phones, so they don't have to buy any ad=
ditional hardware, they just need to download an app.=20
